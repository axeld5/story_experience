The year was 1177 of the Sun-King's Reign when the whispers of the Sand-Ship Armada first reached the ears of the Oasis of Aken-Thar.  Led by the infamous Dune-Reaver, a man whose face was perpetually masked by a veil of woven silk and whose name was only spoken in hushed tones, these nomads of the Shifting Sands had perfected the art of desert navigation. Their vessels, vast ships crafted from hardened sand-wood and propelled by towering canvas sails, glided across the endless ochre waves, a terrifying sight against the azure sky.  The Armada had already ravaged several smaller oases, their swift attacks leaving behind only plundered stores of precious water and spice, the lifeblood of the desert communities.  Word came that the Dune-Reaver's second-in-command, a fearsome warrior known as the Sand-Serpent, had personally overseen the brutal sacking of the Oasis of Jadar, just three weeks prior to the current rumors.

The Sheikh of Aken-Thar, the wise and aging Karim al-Hassan, knew that defense was paramount. He ordered the ancient fortifications reinforced, the meager garrison of spear-wielders and archers positioned strategically along the walls. The oasis dwellers, a blend of settled farmers and traders, prepared for the inevitable onslaught. Among them was young Zara, daughter of the Oasis Elder, a skilled archer whose arrows had brought down sand-vipers and scorpions from impossible distances. She watched the horizon with a steely gaze, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and determination. It was said that the Dune-Reaver himself never disembarked during a raid, orchestrating his forces from the command deck of his flagship, *The Obsidian Wave*.

On the third day of the eleventh moon, under the harsh glare of the twin suns, the Sand-Ship Armada appeared. A terrifying sight of sails billowing and sand churning, a dozen colossal vessels advanced on Aken-Thar. The battle for the oasis began. The air filled with the twang of bowstrings, the clash of steel, and the guttural war cries of the raiders as they swarmed the walls. Sheikh Karim directed the defense with calm resolve, while Zara's arrows found their mark with deadly accuracy, felling several attackers attempting to scale the parapets. The Sand-Serpent, a whirlwind of violence, cut through the defenders at the gate, his curved blade flashing in the sunlight. The fate of Aken-Thar hung in the balance, a desperate struggle against the masters of the sand-sea.
