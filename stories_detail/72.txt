In the Sun-Scoured Expanse, circa 1147 AE (After Expansion), the legend of the Sand-Ship Armada struck fear into the hearts of sedentary peoples.  Led by the enigmatic "Dune-King" Xerxes, a man whose face was always veiled by windswept silks, these colossal, sail-rigged vessels, crafted from sun-hardened hide and desert woods by the "Shipwrights of the Shifting Sands," would emerge from the rolling dunes like ships from a mythical ocean.  Their target: the verdant lifeblood of the region, the oasis settlements, particularly the prosperous "Green Bastion" of Oasis Prime, repeatedly plundered in daring dawn raids by Xerxes' elite raiders, the "Sons of the Simoom," who descended from the decks of the flagship, the *Golden Serpent*, their scimitars flashing in the harsh desert sun.
