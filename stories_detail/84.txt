The Order of Aural Absence, or the "Silence Brokers" as they were known in the shadowed alleyways of early 17th Century **Prague**, was founded by the enigmatic alchemist **Master Ignis**, around **1618**.  Their initial clientele, whispered of in the **Court of Rudolf II**'s final years, were often those with dark secrets to conceal, or powerful merchants like the **Rothblatt** family, eager to conduct clandestine deals without the clatter of the outside world intruding.  One notable transaction in **1625**, meticulously recorded in a heavily encrypted ledger found years later in a hidden chamber beneath the **St. Vitus Cathedral**, involved the complete aural sanitization of a small villa on the outskirts of **Paris** for a figure only identified as "The Cardinal," his reasons for needing such absolute quiet forever lost to history, a testament to the Silence Brokers' ultimate product.
