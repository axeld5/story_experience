The annals of the Third Republic, specifically the dusty archives within the Grand Biblioth√®que of Aethelgard, whisper of the earliest verifiable mentions of the Silence Brokers.  Dated entries from the "Journal of Inquisitor Maximus, 1142 AE" describe a clandestine group capable of rendering a merchant's guild hall utterly soundless during a tense negotiation on the Docks of Port Azure.  It is here that the enigmatic "Master Valerius," often cited as a co-founder alongside the equally elusive "Lady Seraphina," makes his first appearance, the entries noting his unsettling ability to gesture away a riot's roar as if swatting a fly. Their services, initially catering to nervous diplomats and illicit gamblers, quickly expanded, becoming a sought-after commodity by those with secrets to keep.

By the dawn of the Fifth Era, 1487 AE, the Silence Brokers had established themselves as a powerful, albeit invisible, force. Their headquarters, rumored to be located beneath the sprawling markets of the Free City of Korthos, remained a well-guarded secret. Their agents, known colloquially as "Mutes," were said to wield strange artifacts and possess innate abilities, capable of weaving intricate fields of absolute quietude. The "Great Silence of the Iron Throne," a documented event from 1503 AE during the siege of Fort Resolute, where the roar of catapults and the clash of swords were nullified over a crucial twenty-four-hour period, is widely attributed to the Brokers' intervention, allegedly brokered by the shrewd "Duke Thorne."

The peak of the Silence Brokers' influence is generally placed around 1650 AE. Treaties were signed under their blanket of quiet, assassinations went unheard, and entire battlefields fell silent for strategic advantage. The notorious "Soundless Coup of Eldoria," in 1678 AE, orchestrated by the ambitious "Consul Veridia," would have been impossible without their services, a testament to their reach and the lengths to which power-seekers would go to acquire their unique brand of peace. While their activities have become more fragmented in recent centuries, whispers of the Silence Brokers and their unsettling trade in silence continue to echo in the shadowed corners of history.
