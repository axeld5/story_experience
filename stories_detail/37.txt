The Great Sundering, dated by the First Chroniclers as occurring circa 12,000 Cycles Before the Scab Age, left the World with scars of unimaginable scale. It was upon these monstrous, calcified wounds of the fallen World-Devourers that the Scar Tissue Kingdoms rose.  One of the earliest and most enduring was the Kingdom of the Great Spine, built along the ridged, fossilized vertebrae of what is now called the 'Elder Serpent.' For centuries, the Spine Kings, beginning with King Thorin the Scar-Forged in 300 SA (Scab Age), ruled with a firm, almost brittle hand, their society stratified by their proximity to the vital, still-warm marrow flows within the bone.  The high castes, the 'Marrow-Kindred,' lived within the deepest chambers, while the lower 'Spine-Scrapers' eked out a precarious existence on the outer, eroded plates, perpetually threatened by the 'Bone-Dust Plagues' that drifted from the ancient wounds.

Life within the Scar Kingdoms was one of adaptation and constant vigilance. The 'Wound-Weavers' of the Sunken Maw, a kingdom nestled in the cavernous throat of a long-dead beast near the Black Salt Flats, developed an intricate system of scaffolding and pulley systems to navigate the treacherous, still-shifting tissues. Their King, the pragmatic Kaelen the Mouth-Bound (reigned 650-688 SA), focused his efforts on cultivating the strange, resilient flora that grew from the beast's corrupted blood, a vital resource traded across the 'Great Crust.' Meanwhile, in the Shattered Heartlands, built upon the calcified arteries of a colossal, avian entity, the 'Artery-Runners' became renowned for their daring expeditions into the still-pulsing remnants of the beast's circulatory system, seeking lost artifacts and dangerous but valuable fluids. Their leader, the fearless Lady Anya of the Crimson Vein (born 712 SA), spearheaded an unprecedented alliance with the neighbouring Spine Kingdoms in 755 SA, a fragile peace treaty etched onto a fragment of a massive, fossilized heart valve.

The Scar Tissue Kingdoms, while often isolated by the very terrain that defined them, shared a common heritage of survival and resilience. Their histories are replete with tales of heroes like Joryn the Bone-Breaker, who defended the Spine Kingdom from a devastating 'Bone-Grub Infestation' in 420 SA, and the tragic fall of the Kingdom of the Eye of the Storm, swallowed by a sudden reopening of a colossal tear in the landscape near the Whispering Peaks around 890 SA. These societies, born from the catastrophic end of an age, found a way to thrive, their cultures shaped by the enduring, monumental wounds of the past.
