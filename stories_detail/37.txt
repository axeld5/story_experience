The year is 1283 Post-Cataclysm.  The Aorta Scar, a chasm carved by the final, dying surge of the Behemoth of the Crimson Tides, ran like a crimson vein across the land. It was within this perpetually seeping, yet miraculously healing, fissure that the nascent kingdoms of the Scarlands took root.  Before then, scattered tribes lived on the fringes of the Behemoth’s stillness, fearful of its silent power.

One such tribe, the Bone-Sifters of the northern plains, were led by a woman named Kaelen of the Obsidian Eye. It was Kaelen who, in 1279 PC, dared to venture into the Aorta Scar's periphery. Her people, facing a harsh winter and dwindling prey, were desperate. They found sustenance in the strange, nutrient-rich flora that sprouted from the Behemoth’s scar tissue, and refuge within the calcified ridges of the wound.

By 1290 PC, Kaelen had established the first Scar Kingdom, known as Aortia. It was a brutal, practical society. Life revolved around harvesting the strange resources of the Scar and defending against opportunistic raiders from the outer lands who saw the Scarlands as ripe for plunder. Kaelen, now Queen Kaelen I, ruled with a hand as firm as the Behemoth’s own scar tissue.

To the south, nestled within the immense, glassy expanse left by the Lumina Serpent's death throes, arose the realm of Serpentine Glass. This kingdom, founded around 1295 PC by the visionary architect, Master Elara of the Shimmering Sands, focused on utilizing the unique properties of the Glass Scar. Buildings were constructed from the hardened luminescence, creating structures that glowed with an ethereal light.

Elara’s kingdom was vastly different from Aortia. While Aortia focused on survival and resource extraction, Serpentine Glass valued knowledge and artistry. Their scholars, known as the Glazewrights, dedicated themselves to understanding the biology of the Lumina Serpent and the strange energies that still pulsed within its scar. Trade flourished between Serpentine Glass and the few other fledgling Scar kingdoms, exchanging knowledge for Aortian meat and the tough, flexible hides harvested from the Scar.

However, peace was a fragile thing in the Scarlands. The Scar of the Hundred Eyes, a vast, pitted landscape left by a creature of unimaginable size and many organs, became the heart of the kingdom of Ocularis around 1310 PC. Ocularis, led by the ambitious and ruthless Warlord Theron of the Prying Gaze, was built on militarism and conquest. They saw the other Scar kingdoms not as neighbors, but as potential resources to be absorbed.

Theron's armies, utilizing the strange, resilient materials harvested from the Hundred Eyes Scar, began to probe the borders of Aortia and Serpentine Glass in the early 1320s PC. The Scar Wars, a brutal conflict that would last for decades, had begun. Kaelen I, now an aging but still formidable ruler, forged a tentative alliance with Queen Elara of Serpentine Glass.

The year 1335 PC saw the Siege of the Shimmering Citadel, a key city in Serpentine Glass. Theron's forces, with their seemingly endless supply of strange armaments, pushed hard against the glowing defenses. It was during this siege that a young Aortian commander, Bram of the Iron Will, distinguished himself, leading a daring counter-attack that broke the Ocularian lines.

Bram's victory was a turning point. He rose quickly through the ranks, eventually becoming King of Aortia after Kaelen I's death in 1340 PC. His reign, marked by strategic brilliance and a deep understanding of the Scarlands, brought relative stability to the region. He brokered a lasting, if uneasy, peace with Serpentine Glass and managed to push back the relentless advance of Ocularis, though Theron and his kingdom remained a constant threat, forever gazing with their countless, metaphorical eyes upon their neighbors. The Scar Tissue Kingdoms, born of pain and death, continued to heal and grow upon the very wounds of the ancient world.
