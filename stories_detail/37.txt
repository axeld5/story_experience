The year is 721 AE (After Empyrean), and the Scar-Cities, those bastions of humanity carved from the petrified and pulsating flesh of the fallen titans, knew no true peace. On the colossal, still-weeping wound known as the "Great Scar of the Leviathan," the burgeoning kingdom of Veridian, under the pragmatic rule of King Valerius the Builder, clashed constantly with the nomadic tribes who revered the beast's heart-muscle as sacred ground. Across the "Splintered Plains," a vast stretch of calcified titan bone riddled with treacherous fissures, the tyrannical Lord Kaelan of Ironwood sought to subjugate the free city of Aethelburg, a haven for scholars and healers who studied the unique flora and fauna that blossomed from the titan's decaying form. Meanwhile, far to the south, within the cavernous "Vein-Labyrinth" of the Elder Dragon's corpse, the shadowed kingdom of Umbra whispered of forgotten powers still stirring within the beast's core, a threat that even the hardened warriors of the Scar-Cities feared. Amidst these turbulent times, the legendary hero, Commander Lyra of the Scar-Knights, earned her fame defending the city of Citadel, built precariously on a titan's exposed spine, from a monstrous eruption of necrotic flesh â€“ a stark reminder that the old wounds, though ancient, were far from healed.
