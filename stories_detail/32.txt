The First Age, during the Reign of High King Atheria of the Sunstone Peaks, saw the first confirmed accounts of the Obsidian Loom.  Ancient texts, unearthed from the ruins of Eldoria circa 347 FA, speak of the artifact not as a tool, but as a sentient entity, its threads of midnight weaving the very fabric of existence.  It was said that the goddess Morwenna, Weaver of Stars, jealously guarded its secrets within the hidden chamber of the Silent Citadel.  Yet, whispers of its reality-altering power reached the ears of mortal kings and ambitious mages. Lord Varen, the Shadow Hand of the Northern Marches, funded expeditions into the forbidden lands, driven by a thirst to rewrite his own tragic history, while the Oracle of Aethel, a seer of immense power, sought the Loom not for personal gain, but to untangle the tangled threads of a prophecy foretelling a coming darkness.

The Second Age, marked by the Wars of Succession and the rise of the Obsidian Empire, saw the Loom become a focal point of conflict. Emperor Kaelen the Ruthless, in 589 SA, launched a brutal campaign to seize the artifact, believing he could weave an era of eternal dominion. He clashed with the Order of the Silver Thread, a clandestine group sworn to protect the balance of fate, led by the enigmatic Master Lyra. Their skirmishes in the desolate plains of the Whispering Wastes and the treacherous passes of the Serpent's Coil became legendary. The Emperor's relentless pursuit, however, only served to draw the attention of even older, more potent entities â€“ beings that dwelled beyond the mortal realms, also coveting the Loom's immense power.
