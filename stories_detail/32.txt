The year was 783 AC, and the whispers of the Obsidian Loom, a relic of the Elder Gods, reached the ears of High Priestess Elara of the Sunstone Citadel, a place of ancient wisdom nestled in the Aetherian Peaks.  Meanwhile, in the war-torn plains of Eldoria, General Valerius the Ironclad, a veteran of the Blood Moon Wars, received intel from a captured cultist of the Shadow Weavers detailing the Loom's purported location within the Serpent's Maw, a perilous chasm beneath the ruins of Old Cygnus.  Across the sea, the enigmatic collector known only as the Azure Hand, residing in the opulent city of Silverhaven, dispatched his most trusted agent, Lyra the Whisperwind, to track the Loom's fragmented legends, hoping to seize its reality-altering power before either the zealous High Priestess or the ruthless General could claim it.
