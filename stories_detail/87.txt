The wind, a constant companion in the Endless White, carried the scent of salt and distance. Here, in the heart of the Salsan Expanse, where the horizon shimmered with mirages and the sun bleached the very air, lived the one known only as the Salt Mystic. His true name, lost to the mists of time and the erosion of memory, was whispered to be Elias of Orencia, though none living could confirm it. He arrived in the year of the Long Drought, 873 AG (After the Great Unification), a solitary figure emerging from the blinding glare, draped in coarse, salt-encrusted robes.

His dwelling was a marvel of adaptation and strange artistry. Carved into a massive, naturally occurring salt dome, it was less a house and more a series of crystalline chambers. The walls pulsed with a soft, internal light, reflecting the intricate patterns he coaxed from the salt deposits. For Elias did not just dwell in the salt; he communed with it. He spoke of the ‘mineral elementals,’ silent entities that resided within the very fabric of the earth, their whispers echoing in the formations of gypsum and halite.

His renown grew slowly, carried on the lips of the few hardy caravans that dared traverse the Salsan Expanse. Merchants, desperate for a glimpse of the future before risking valuable cargo on perilous routes, would seek him out, their faces etched with a mixture of hope and trepidation. Among them was Lady Anya of the Silver Hand Trading Company, a shrewd businesswoman whose fortunes hinged on safe passage through the treacherous Serpent’s Pass. In the summer of 889 AG, she sought Elias’s counsel regarding a rumored bandit lord operating near the pass.

Elias, his eyes a pale, piercing blue against his weathered face, would lead them into his central chamber. There, on a large, flat crystal of pure halite, he would begin his scrying. He did not use water or smoke like common seers. Instead, he would gently manipulate the ambient humidity and temperature, coaxing delicate, ephemeral structures of salt to form on the crystal's surface. These patterns, he claimed, were the language of the elementals, revealing glimpses of what was to come.

Lady Anya watched, her usual composure wavering, as spidery branches of salt grew and then dissolved on the crystal. Elias’s voice, dry and rasping like the wind, described a “serpent’s coil of danger” around the pass and the glint of “false gold.” He advised her to reroute her caravan through the lesser-known Sunstone Valley, a path considered safer but longer and more arduous. Despite her initial reluctance, the specificity of his vision—he even described the distinctive scar across the bandit leader’s face, though he had never seen him—convinced her.

Her decision proved wise. News arrived weeks later that the bandit lord, a notorious figure named Kaelen the Scarred, had indeed ambushed a merchant caravan attempting to cross the Serpent's Pass, a caravan that had dismissed the Mystic's warnings. Lady Anya’s goods arrived safely in the bustling port city of Aethelgard, her profits secured. The tale of the Salt Mystic’s accurate prophecy spread like wildfire, solidifying his reputation as a seer of unparalleled ability, at least within the treacherous confines of the Expanse.

Not all who sought Elias’s wisdom came for commercial gain. In the spring of 901 AG, a young woman named Elara, her heart heavy with grief, journeyed to the Salt Mystic's dwelling. Her brother, a skilled prospector named Jax, had vanished weeks earlier in the uncharted salt fields bordering the Whisperwind Dunes, a region notorious for its shifting sands and hidden sinkholes. The authorities in the nearby settlement of Haven’s Edge had given up the search.

Elias, sensing her despair, allowed her into his sacred chamber. The salt formations that arose for Elara were turbulent and chaotic at first, reflecting her inner turmoil. But as Elias guided the scrying, a clearer image began to emerge: a collapsed crevice, the glint of a pickaxe, and a single, resilient desert bloom clinging to a rock face. He directed her to a specific location, a cluster of ancient, petrified salt cedars known as the ‘Whispering Giants.’

Though the journey was perilous and the hope slim, Elara, armed with the Salt Mystic’s cryptic map of formations and directions, ventured into the dunes. After days of searching, guided only by her faith in the recluse, she discovered the collapsed sinkhole and, nearby, the tenacious desert bloom exactly as Elias had described. Digging frantically, she eventually found her brother, injured but alive, sheltered within a small, air pocket formed by the collapse. Jax’s survival was a miracle attributed entirely to the Salt Mystic’s foresight.

Despite the growing reverence surrounding him, Elias remained a figure of mystery. He rarely spoke of himself, his past, or the nature of his connection to the salt. Some whispered that he was not entirely human, that the mineral elementals had somehow claimed a part of him. Others believed he was an ancient sage, gifted with sight beyond mortal comprehension. He accepted no payment for his visions, asking only for offerings of fresh water and news from the outside world.

And so, the Salt Mystic continued his solitary vigil in the heart of the Endless White. His legend grew with each accurate prophecy, each life saved by his crystalline visions. He remained a testament to the strange and potent forces that resided in the desolate beauty of the Salsan Expanse, a hermit who found the future not in the stars or the swirling winds, but in the silent, intricate language of salt.
