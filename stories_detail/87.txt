The annals of the Aethelian Empire, specifically the "Chronicles of the Azure Wastes," first speak of him as *Solon the Scryer*, around the year 347 AE.  He was no ordinary recluse, choosing the blinding expanse of the Great Salt Sea flats near the desolate outpost of Port Obsidian as his domain.  Here, under the relentless sun of the 17th of Hearthfire, Solon communed not with spirits of wind or water, but with the very heart of the earth itself.  He would spend days in silent contemplation, observing the intricate geometries of salt crystals forming upon the parched ground, interpreting their fleeting patterns as whispers of futures yet to unfold. Local prospectors, wary but also awed, reported seeing him engaged in fervent, wordless dialogues with what they described as "glimmering, humanoid forms," which they attributed to the *Golems of the Deep Salt*, elemental beings said to reside within the mineral veins.

His true renown, however, came later, during the desperate days of the Second Northern Invasion of 355 AE. The Emperor Valerius III, faced with overwhelming odds on the Plains of Sorrows, sent desperate emissaries across the treacherous flats to seek Solon's counsel. The "Salt Mystic," as he was now commonly known, received the envoys on the 3rd of Bloomtide, his face etched with the stark beauty of the salt. He did not speak of troop movements or battle strategies. Instead, he presented them with a single, perfectly formed salt crystal, explaining its facets foretold of a specific weakness in the Kaelan war machines, a truth revealed to him by the *Salt Elementals* themselves. This seemingly cryptic message, when interpreted by the Emperor's most astute engineers, led to the development of a specialized corrosive agent, a turning point in the conflict and securing Solon's legend.

Following the victory at the Battle of the Azure Scar in the autumn of 355 AE, Solon retreated even deeper into his salt-dusted solitude. While his direct involvement in political affairs ceased, stories of his prescient visions continued to circulate. Merchants travelling the treacherous Salt Road in the spring of 360 AE spoke of seeing him standing amidst newly formed salt pillars, his gaze fixed on the horizon as if anticipating distant events. The "Whispers of Solon," as his prophecies were now known, were sought after, though his location remained elusive, a testament to his profound connection with the elemental forces of the salt, a true mystic of the mineral realm.
