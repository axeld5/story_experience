In the desolate expanse of the Kavir Salt Flats, around the year 978 CE, resided a figure known only as the Salt Mystic, or by some as the Crystal Oracle of Dasht-e Kavir. His hermitage, a simple structure of sun-baked mud and salvaged flotsam, was a landmark of whispered legends across the Great Salt Desert. He was not of noble lineage like Prince Ardeshir nor a renowned scholar like Imam al-Hasan, but a recluse who spoke the language of the earth itself. It is said that during the Great Drought of 982, as the land thirsted and settlements like Yazd and Isfahan suffered, the Salt Mystic would spend days in the crystalline heart of the salt pans, deciphering the intricate patterns formed by the evaporating water. His prophecies, conveyed in cryptic riddles, reached the ears of regional governors and caravan leaders, guiding them to hidden, brackish springs and foretelling the coming of the much-anticipated rains in the spring of 983. He was a silent guardian of the arid realm, his wisdom etched not on parchment but in the very structure of the land.
