The annals of the Valley Kingdom of Oakhaven record the first incursions of the Skybreaker Clan around the 4th Age, in the spring of 378 AE. From the treacherous, cloud-kissed peaks of the Aethelgard Range, they descended, not on foot, but upon strange, bat-winged contraptions. Led by chieftains of fearsome reputation, such as Kaelen Stonefist and Lyra Stormrider, they were a terrifying sight, their war cries echoing down the mountainsides. These barbarians, born and raised in the thin, unforgiving air, possessed an uncanny connection to the giant sky-whales and thunder-hawks that dwelled amongst the highest peaks. Their raids were swift and brutal, striking villages like Porthaven and Riverbend with little warning, before vanishing back into the azure heights with stolen livestock and precious metals.

It was during the reign of King Theron II, in the summer of 412 AE, that the Skybreakers' raids reached their peak. A particularly daring attack on the fortified town of Eldoria saw Chieftain Borin Eaglespire lead a force directly over the town walls, a feat previously thought impossible. The bravery and ferocity of warriors like Mara Windwhisper, who was said to have fought off a dozen Oakhaven guards with only a bone axe, became legendary, even amongst their enemies. The Valley Kingdom, accustomed to ground warfare, struggled to adapt to this new threat from the skies, and whispers of appeasement or even retreat began to circulate amongst the noble houses of the Vale.

However, the tide of the Skybreaker threat eventually began to ebb, though not without further bloodshed. The development of specialized anti-air ballistae by Master Artificer Elara of the Ironwood Guild in 435 AE provided the Oakhaven forces with a means to challenge the Skybreakers in their element. Coupled with internal feuding amongst the Skybreaker chieftains themselves, exacerbated by harsh winters and dwindling game on the peaks, the frequency and intensity of the raids began to decline. While occasional skirmishes still occurred in the borderlands even as late as the 5th Age, the era of the Skybreaker Clan's dominance over the skies above the Valley Kingdom had, by the early 450s AE, drawn to a close.
