The Year of the Screaming Storm, according to the Valley Dwellers' calendars – roughly 742 AE (After the Empire), though such precise reckonings held little sway amongst the Skybreaker Clan. Their lives were marked by the cycles of the Great Flyers, the colossal, winged behemoths that soared through the frigid air currents around their mountain peaks. The Skybreakers, perched upon the dizzying spires of the Aethelgard Range, were a people forged in the crucible of wind and stone.

Their settlements, clusters of sturdy, low-slung buildings hewn from the very rock face, clung to the most sheltered crags. Names like Kael’s Perch and the Eyrie of the Wyrm-Slayer echoed through the clan’s oral histories. Their leader during this period was Chieftain Borin Stonefist, a grizzled warrior with a face etched by wind and a spirit as unyielding as the mountains themselves. Borin had led the Skybreakers through countless hunts and raids, his name a whisper of fear in the valleys below.

The Skybreakers’ unique weapon was the wind itself. They were masters of the glider, intricate contraptions of treated hide stretched over lightweight bone and wood frames. These weren’t crude kites, but carefully crafted wings that allowed them to launch from the mountain peaks and ride the powerful thermals, descending upon the unsuspecting valley settlements like hawks.

One such raid occurred in the late autumn of 742 AE. The target was the town of Oakhaven, nestled beside the fertile River Vesper. Led by Borin’s most promising warrior, a young woman named Lyra, who had already earned the honorific “Stormwing” for her daring glider flights, a band of twenty Skybreakers launched from the highest peak. The gliders, painted with ochre and blood-red symbols, were barely visible against the bruised twilight sky.

The descent was swift and silent. Lyra, her long braids whipping in the wind, guided her glider with practiced ease, the rush of air in her ears a familiar song. They landed on the outskirts of Oakhaven just as the first watchman was raising the alarm. The ensuing chaos was a testament to the Skybreakers’ ferocity. They were not a conquering army seeking land, but raiders seeking supplies – grain, livestock, and whatever precious metals the Valley Dwellers had accumulated.

While the raid on Oakhaven was successful, it came at a cost. Two Skybreakers were lost to the villagers’ desperate defense, their bodies falling from the rooftops like broken dolls. Lyra herself sustained a nasty gash on her arm, a reminder of the risks inherent in their way of life. Despite the losses, they returned to the Aethelgard Range laden with provisions, their gliders heavy with the spoils of the raid.

The true test of the Skybreakers’ strength, however, was the hunt. The Great Flyers were their most valuable prey, their tough hides providing the material for gliders and their massive bones for tools and weapons. The most sought-after were the Elder Wyrms, creatures of immense size and power that rarely descended low enough for a glider to effectively engage them.

In the spring of 743 AE, a sighting of an Elder Wyrm, a creature rumored to be over a century old, sent a tremor of excitement and fear through the Skybreaker settlements. It was seen circling the highest peak, its shadow casting a pall over Kael’s Perch. Borin declared a Great Hunt, a risky endeavor that would require the combined might and skill of the clan.

Lyra, as the most skilled glider and a proven leader, was given a prominent role in the hunt. The strategy was daring: several gliders would distract the Wyrm, attempting to lure it towards a narrow chasm where spearmen and axe-wielding warriors waited on the cliff faces. It was a plan fraught with peril, one miscalculation meaning certain death.

The hunt lasted for two days. The roar of the Elder Wyrm echoed through the mountains, a terrifying sound that chilled the blood. Gliders darted around the beast like angry wasps, their pilots demonstrating incredible bravery and skill. Lyra, her arm still bandaged from the Oakhaven raid, flew closer than anyone, drawing the Wyrm's attention with her audacious maneuvers.

Finally, the Wyrm, enraged and disoriented, was lured into the chasm. The waiting warriors unleashed a barrage of spears and axes, their strikes finding purchase in the beast’s tough hide. The struggle was epic, a battle of ancient power against human ingenuity. The Elder Wyrm, despite its size, was trapped, its roars of pain echoing off the stone walls.

When the dust settled, the Elder Wyrm lay dead in the chasm, a testament to the Skybreakers’ strength and courage. The cost was high – several warriors were lost, crushed by the Wyrm’s thrashing tail or falling from the precipices. But the bounty was immense. The hides, bones, and meat of the creature would sustain the clan for months and provide materials for a new generation of gliders. The Year of the Screaming Storm had ended, but the Skybreakers, the barbarians of the sky, had endured.
