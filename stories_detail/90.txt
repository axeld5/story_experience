The year 1172 of the Sunstone Calendar saw the rise of Chief Vargoth, the Skybreaker, atop the jagged peaks of the Wyvernâ€™s Tooth range. His clan, known throughout the lowlands of the Verdant Valley as the Feathered Terrors, honed their skills in the perilous hunt of the Great Aether-Wings, creatures of immense power that soared through the high air.  Driven by the dwindling resources of their mountain strongholds, particularly the treacherous eyrie known as the Stone Roost, Chief Vargoth orchestrated a daring raid on the prosperous settlement of Oakhaven in the autumn of that year.  He led his bravest warriors, including the legendary glider-master Faelar the Swift and the formidable shaman Kaelen Stoneheart, across the perilous winds on their meticulously crafted gliders, their descent a silent omen of the storm to come upon the unsuspecting valley dwellers.
