The year was 1888, and the cobbled streets of New London hummed with whispers of the 'Memory Thief'.  This elusive rogue, known only by the moniker "The Keeper," operated in the city's underbelly, particularly around the docks of Blackfriars and the shadowy alleys of Whitechapel.  His trade was vile: the extraction and sale of specific recollections, precious moments peddled to the highest bidder on the illicit psychic exchange.  Lord Ashworth, a prominent industrialist, reportedly paid a princely sum for a specific memory of his late wife, stolen from the mind of her grieving sister, Lady Arabella Vance. The Psychic Investigations Bureau, under the steadfast leadership of Inspector Arthur Pendelton, a seasoned telepath himself, had been on The Keeper's trail for months, frustrated by his ability to vanish like smoke in the bustling metropolis.

The Bureau's most promising lead came in the autumn of that year, delivered by a network of informants centered around the clandestine psychic salons of Bloomsbury. A tip suggested The Keeper kept a 'Ledger,' a physical record of his transactions and, more importantly, a repository of the stolen memories themselves, held in intricate psychic resonance within the very ink. Amelia Davies, a young but exceptionally gifted empath assigned to the case, felt the chilling echoes of countless lives in her mind whenever she drew close to places The Keeper was suspected of frequenting. Their pursuit intensified, leading them through the city's labyrinthine network of sewers and disused underground tunnels, mirroring the murky depths of the human mind The Keeper so easily plundered. The Ledger, they believed, was the key to not only stopping The Keeper but also potentially restoring the lost fragments of lives he had so cruelly fractured.
