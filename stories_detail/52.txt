In the humid summer of 2077 in Neo-Chicago, a shadowy figure known only as "The Mnemonist," later identified as Silas Vane of the North Side, began their nefarious trade.  Operating from the labyrinthine corridors of the old O'Hare district, Vane, a rogue telepath of exceptional talent, systematically pilfered and peddled specific, valuable memories – a CEO's secret launch code, a scientist's revolutionary formula, a lover's most cherished moment – on the digital black market, a thriving underworld centered in the subterranean levels of the former Loop financial district.  Tasked with bringing The Mnemonist to justice was the fledgling Psychic Investigations Unit, established in 2075 under the command of Chief Investigator Anya Sharma, a renowned empath from the European Enclave, and aided by Lieutenant Kenji Tanaka, a gifted precog from the Kyoto Augmentation Academy, who relentlessly pursued Vane across the sprawling metropolis, their psychic senses straining to decipher the ghostly echoes left by the stolen thoughts.
