In the desolate lands of Ashfall, year 742 of the Eldorian Calendar, young Kaelen, a seasoned veteran of the Battle of Blackwood Pass, found himself heir not to wealth, but to the "Crimson Ash," a legendary blade said to be forged in the heart of the Scarred Peaks. This cursed weapon, once wielded by the infamous Wraith Lord, Alaric the Soul-Drinker, possessed a chilling ability: it consumed the essence of those it struck down, forcing the wielder to relive their final, agonizing moments. Kaelen, bound by blood and duty to the lineage of the Ashwood Clan, a line known for their stoicism and resilience even in the face of grim destiny, accepted the burden, the weight of centuries of dying souls settling upon his young shoulders as he gripped the hilt, the air around him growing cold and thin, thick with the echoes of countless final breaths.
