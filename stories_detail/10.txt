The year was 1187 of the Common Era, and the region of Aethelgard lay under the shadow of the burgeoning Crimson Ash, a blight whispered to have been birthed from the very earth during the Battle of the Black Sands two decades prior.  Lord Kaelen, a seasoned veteran of that brutal conflict and a man known for his stoic demeanor, found himself summoned to the hallowed halls of the Keep of Oakhaven, ancestral home of the House of Ash.  There, on his deathbed, the aging High Lord Valerius Ash, the last of his direct line, bequeathed upon Kaelen the Crimson Ashblade, a weapon of fearsome renown, said to have been forged in the heart of a fallen star. Valerius's dying words, rasped and broken, spoke not of glory or power, but of a terrible legacy: "It thirsts, Kaelen. It remembers."

Kaelen, now elevated to the title of Lord Regent and tasked with safeguarding the fragile peace of Aethelgard, soon learned the chilling truth of Valerius's warning. The Crimson Ashblade was no mere weapon; it was a conduit for torment. Each life it claimed, whether during a skirmish with the rogue bandits of the Serpent's Coil in the Autumn of 1188 or in a tense duel with the exiled Knight of the Ironwood, Sir Gareth, in the Spring of 1189, became an echoing scream within Kaelen's mind. He was forced to witness, over and over, the final, desperate moments of his victims â€“ the terror in their eyes, the chill of death's embrace, the profound regret of lives cut short. This constant replay of dying souls began to fray at his sanity, the spectral whispers of the Ashblade a constant companion. The burden of the blade, a cursed heirloom of the Crimson Ash Legacy, proved heavier than any armor he had ever worn.
