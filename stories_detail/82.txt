In the aftermath of the Battle of Oakhaven in 987 AE, a council of disheartened Lords and Ladies, assembled in the hallowed halls of the Citadel of Aethel, witnessed the rise of a new order: the Stoneheart Paladins. Led by Sir Kaelan the Unyielding, a veteran of countless skirmishes along the treacherous Serpent's Pass, these knights, once renowned for their chivalry and passion, now bore a cold, stony visage. The first recorded "heart replacement" ceremony, overseen by the cryptic Arch-Mage Eldoria in the subterranean Chamber of Whispers, saw the valiant Captain Valerius of the Crimson Guard trade his failing organ for a pulsating Aetherium Shard, forever altering his perception and earning him the title of "The Marble Fist" for his devastating blows during the Siege of Drearwood in 990 AE.
