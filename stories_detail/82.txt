The Annals of Aethelburg speak in hushed tones of the first Stoneheart, Sir Kaelen of the White Tower. It was the grim year of 978 AE (After Empire), during the Siege of Blackwood Keep, that the failing heart of the legendary Knight-Captain threatened to end his life and the defense of the realm. In a desperate act, Magister Eldrin Sunstrider, then Archmage of the Silver Spire, performed a forbidden ritual, replacing Kaelen's ailing organ with a flawlessly cut and enchanted Bloodstone. The immediate result was terrifying; Kaelen, previously known for his boisterous laughter and deep empathy, became a silent, unyielding engine of destruction. He broke the siege single-handedly, his movements precise and devoid of hesitation, his strength seemingly boundless. News of the "Stoneheart" spread like wildfire through the warring kingdoms of the North.

Other knights, facing certain death from failing hearts or seeking unparalleled martial prowess, sought out the forbidden ritual. Lord Valerius of the Iron Gauntlet, in 985 AE, willingly underwent the transformation after a brutal battle left him mortally wounded. His strategic brilliance remained, but the compassion that had made him beloved by his men vanished, replaced by a cold, calculated efficiency. Baroness Lyra of the Crimson Plain, in 992 AE, a renowned healer who lost her empathy, became a terrifyingly effective field commander, her decisions guided solely by tactical advantage, regardless of the human cost. These Stoneheart Paladins, as they came to be known, were instrumental in the wars that followed, their unfeeling nature making them terrifying opponents on the fields of the Sunken Marshes and the Whispering Peaks.

Yet, the price of such power was immense. The Stonehearts were revered for their strength but feared for their lack of humanity. Their families mourned the loss of the person they once knew, replaced by an automaton in familiar armor. The Council of the Seven Cities, in 1010 AE, formally debated their place in society, with many arguing that their lack of emotion made them unfit for leadership. The very strength that saved realms also isolated them, leaving a legacy of both triumph and profound, echoing emptiness in the historical records of the Age of Stone.
