The Scarring of Eldoria, 872 ATC (After the Collapse), began not with thunder, but with a silence so profound it stole the breath from the Watchers on the High Spire of Astravia.  The Great Void Kraken, a creature whispered of in ancient prophecies but never truly believed, ripped through the fabric of reality above the Azure Sea.  Its passage, a colossal shadow against a sky that bled colors no artist could replicate, lasted mere minutes by the reckoning of Chronomancer Elara of the Obsidian Archives. But those minutes carved a wound into the world. The immediate effects were catastrophic: the Azure Sea boiled, its once-vibrant ecosystem annihilated, replaced by a viscous, iridescent sludge. Coastal cities like Port Lyra, famed for its pearl fisheries, were swallowed whole by dimensional distortions that twisted stone and flesh into grotesque new forms.  Survivor accounts, such as the harrowing "Testimony of Fisherman Garret," speak of a pervasive dread, a feeling of being utterly insignificant in the face of cosmic indifference, a psychological scar as deep as the environmental one.

The decades that followed, often termed the "Stillness Years," saw the true breadth of the Void Kraken's devastation unfold. The scar in the sky, known now as the "Rift of Despair," bled unstable energies, causing unpredictable weather patterns and mutating flora and fauna across the continent of Xylos. The vibrant Heartwood Forests withered, their ancient trees becoming brittle, lightless husks. New, terrifying creatures, born of the mingled void energies and the wounded world, emerged from the warped landscape â€“ the Shimmering Abominations of the Salt Wastes and the Whispering Vines of the Dying Woods becoming constant threats. The psychological impact lingered, giving rise to widespread nihilism and despair. The Order of Solace, founded by the compassionate Healer Seraphina of the Whispering Caves, struggled to mend the shattered minds of those who had witnessed the impossible, their efforts a small beacon in a darkening world.

Attempts to understand and mitigate the damage proved largely futile. The Guild of Arcane Study, led by the brilliant but ultimately broken Arch-Mage Theron of the Silver Tower, dedicated generations to researching the Rift and the Void Kraken's wake, but their findings only confirmed the scale of the catastrophe. Entire libraries of knowledge, like those in the lost city of Valeron, were believed to hold clues to the Void Kraken's nature and potential countermeasures, but they were inaccessible, trapped behind the unstable reality of the Rift's edge. The "Reclamation Efforts" launched by the Council of Eldoria, aimed at restoring the ravaged lands, met with limited success, often hampered by the very energies they sought to contain. The Scarring of Eldoria, 872 ATC, remains a stark reminder of the fragility of their world and the terrifying power that lurks in the void between dimensions.
