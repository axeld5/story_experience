The year is 2347 CE.  Deep in the uncharted reaches of Sector 7G, the orbital defense station *Starlight Aegis*, commanded by Captain Anya Sharma, maintained its solitary watch over the anomaly designated "Zero-Point." For decades, this swirling void had remained quiescent, a scientific curiosity.  However, logs from Cycle 98, Day 3, detail the initial tremors â€“ subtle energy fluctuations that sent shivers through the station's hull and its crew of forty-two.  Chief Engineer Jian Li reported cascading system failures, while Dr. Aris Thorne, the station's xenobiologist, observed unsettling changes in the Zero-Point's visual spectrum, describing "patterns that defy Euclidean geometry."  It was then, under the cold, distant gaze of uncatalogued constellations, that the vigil began to fracture.

By Cycle 99, Day 12, the first incursions commenced. Not physical entities in the traditional sense, but rather insidious distortions of reality, manifesting as flickering phantoms in the corridors and whispers that preyed upon the crew's minds. Ensign Maya Rostova, a junior astrogator, was the first to succumb, found muttering incoherently about "the geometry of fear" before her vital signs ceased. Captain Sharma, a veteran of the Xylos Conflict, maintained a stoic facade, coordinating defensive countermeasures alongside Security Chief Commander Valeriy Petrov. They armed the station's aging particle cannons, a desperate gesture against an enemy that seemed to exist in the very fabric of space-time itself. The *Starlight Aegis*, once a bastion of scientific observation, had become a fragile barrier against a encroaching, unknowable darkness.
