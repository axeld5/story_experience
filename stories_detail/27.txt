The Zero-Point Vigil, as it came to be known, commenced in the solar year 2377, aboard the **Aetherium Bastion**, a station strategically positioned in the void near the **Whispering Maw**, the gateway to the unknown dimension. Captain **Eva Rostova**, a veteran of the **Arcturian Campaigns**, commanded the meager crew of **Thirteen Sentinels** against the creeping dread that manifested as unsettling whispers and fleeting, grotesque shapes in the station's outer viewports. Chief Engineer **Kaelen "Sparks" Thorne**, his hands stained with the grease of countless repairs, fought valiantly to maintain the failing shields and life support systems as the very fabric of reality seemed to fray at their edges. Among the **Thirteen**, the xenolinguist **Dr. Aris Thorne**, Kaelen's estranged sibling, tirelessly attempted to decipher the chilling cosmic language that pulsed from the gateway, hoping to find a means of communication, a flicker of understanding, where only horror seemed to reside. Their actions, recorded in the salvaged **Aetherium Logs**, painted a stark picture of unwavering resolve in the face of an encroaching darkness the likes of which humanity had never before witnessed.
