The year is 1488 A.C., and the chilling peculiarity of Whisperwind Keep, overlooking the treacherous Blighted Fen, had already solidified its grim reputation throughout the Kingdom of Eldoria. Lord Edric Blackwood, its latest in a long line of short-lived occupants, paced the cold stone floors of the Great Hall, the air thick with the phantom scent of ash and the faint cries that presaged the Great Fire of 1491, a tragedy yet three years away but already a palpable presence within the Keep's cursed stones. Just weeks prior, Lady Annelise, his young bride, had been driven to madness by visions of her own demise at the Battle of the Crimson Pass, a conflict that wouldn't erupt until 1495, her terrified screams echoing the phantom clash of steel and the scent of spilled blood that now lingered perpetually in the Solar. Even the seasoned Captain Elias Vance, sworn to protect the Keep's inhabitants, confessed to seeing glimpses of future horrors during his rounds atop the East Tower â€“ fleeting images of a plague that would sweep through the nearby village of Oakhaven in 1502, a silent terror that left him constantly scanning the horizon with a haunted gaze. These were not ghosts of the past, but whispers of the future, turning Whisperwind Keep into a prison of premonition, where the future's tragedies played out on repeat before they even had a chance to unfold in the grim tapestry of time.
