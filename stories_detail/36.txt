The stones of Whisperwind Keep, raised by the iron will of Lord Elias of the Barrens in the year 987 of the Age of Kings, were not silent. From the moment the final battlement was laid, a low hum, barely perceptible yet undeniably present, filled the air.  Initially dismissed as the settling of the foundation or the wind whistling through arrow slits, it soon became clear this wasn't natural.  Lady Eleanor, Elias’s wife and a woman of keen intuition, was the first to speak of it as more than a sound; she described it as a feeling, a cold dread that coiled in her stomach, accompanied by fleeting, disquieting images – a banquet hall collapsing, a child tumbling from a tower window, a battle lost before it was even fought.  For years, the inhabitants of Whisperwind lived under this pall, the "whispers" of the future, though fragmented and often difficult to interpret, casting a shadow over their lives.

It was Sir Kaelan, a veteran knight of the Crimson Order garrisoned at the Keep in 1012, who finally managed to decipher some of the more potent echoes. Through intense meditation within the Keep’s central courtyard, a nexus of the temporal distortions, he saw the fiery collapse of the Great Hall during the Feast of the Winter Solstice of 1025. Guided by these visions, the Keep's architect, Master Alaric, was able to identify structural weaknesses in the Hall's supports, weaknesses that, if left unaddressed, would have indeed led to the foreseen disaster. This preventative action, spurred by the future's mournful warnings, marked a turning point for Whisperwind. No longer was it merely haunted; it was a sentinel, a fortress listening to the potential pains of tomorrow, forever burdened by the knowledge of what might be. The tragedy of the Feast of 1025 was averted, but the whispers continued, foretelling other misfortunes that the occupants of Whisperwind, generation after generation, would strive to prevent.
