The year 1492 AD saw the famed expedition of *Captain Alistair Finch* and his crew, sponsored by the *Royal Society of Exploration*, finally reach the legendary *Peak of Aethelgard*.  For decades, tales had circulated among indigenous tribes of the *Crag-Born Giant*, a dormant deity whose form was said to shape the land itself.  It was *Dr. Elara Vance*, the expedition's lead cartographer and a protégé of the renowned *Professor Erasmus Thorne*, who first recognized the unnatural symmetry of the range, the way the jagged peaks seemed to curve in deliberate, impossible arcs.  *Sergeant Thomas "Ironhide" O'Malley*, the expedition's seasoned scout,, led a small party into the deepest valleys, confirming their astonishing discovery: they stood upon the colossal, petrified hand of a being beyond comprehension, a *Sky-Titan*, whose body now nurtured unique, vibrant ecosystems, a testament to nature's tenacity and the secrets the earth still held in the forgotten lands of *Terra Incognita*.
