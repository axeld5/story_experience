The year was 2742 GCE when the *Odyssey*, an Ark-Class exploration vessel launched from Terra Nova in 2301, finally responded to remote probes near the Kepler-186f system. Inside, among the twenty hibernating colonists, awoke Captain Eva Rostova, her mind a fractured mosaic of a life lived and a future unrealized. Beside her stirred Dr. Jian Li, the mission's xenobotanist, haunted by phantom landscapes and the faces of a family long turned to dust. Further down the cryo-bay, Navigator Kaelen O'Connell wrestled with the ghost of a star chart that no longer aligned with reality, his existential dread a cold current in the silent ship. Their awakening was less a rebirth and more a violent severance from a bygone age, leaving them adrift in a universe that had spun on without them, their purpose as pioneers overshadowed by the crushing weight of centuries lost.
