The year was 2488. The *Odyssey*, a vessel of the United Stellar Collective, drifted silently through the black void, its purpose long forgotten by the nascent civilization back on Earth. Aboard lay the crew of Project Genesis, a daring attempt to seed life on the distant exoplanet Kepler-186f.  Their names, once heralded with fanfare – Commander Elias Thorne, Chief Engineer Anya Sharma, Xenobotanist Dr. Jian Li – were now whispers in the cold metal hull. When the automatic systems, after centuries of silent vigil, finally initiated awakening protocols, it wasn't the gentle transition promised in the pre-sleep briefings. Instead, a jarring cascade of alarms tore them from their artificial slumber. They awoke to a world utterly alien, their minds a tapestry of fragmented memories – glimpses of loved ones long dead, echoes of Earth that felt like a distant dream, and an overwhelming sense of disassociation that gnawed at their sanity.

Their first collective act, on the Sol-Centauri trajectory, over 400 light-years from their origin point, was a desperate scramble for context. The ship's logs, detailing the passage of centuries as a blur of automated maintenance and the slow, inexorable drift, offered little solace. Commander Thorne, his face etched with a confusion that bordered on despair, found himself grappling with the sheer scale of their temporal displacement. Dr. Li, staring blankly at the dormant hydroponics bays, felt a profound existential dread; the very mission they had dedicated their lives to now seemed utterly irrelevant in the face of the unimaginable passage of time. Anya Sharma, ever practical, focused on diagnostics, though the hum of the ancient engines felt like a mocking reminder of their technological isolation. They were ghosts in a machine, their memories echoes in a future they had never anticipated.
