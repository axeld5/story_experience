The year was 1788, a humid summer in the Blackwood Bayou near Fort St. Augustine, Florida.  Colonel Alistair Vance, a man haunted by the loss of his wife, Eleanor, three years prior during the Siege of Charleston, led a small patrol into the region known locally as the Whispering Mire.  Accompanying him were Sergeant Thomas "Iron Will" Mallory, a veteran of the French and Indian War, and two young recruits, Private John Miller from Savannah and Private Samuel Davies from a farm in the Carolinas.  As the sun began to dip below the moss-draped cypress trees, the Mire began its insidious work, weaving visions for each man: Alistair saw Eleanor, her face bathed in ethereal light, calling his name from a clearing that didn't exist; Thomas saw a vision of his lost brother, George, fallen at the Battle of Quebec in 1759, urging him forward; John heard the laughter of his childhood sweetheart, Sarah, echoing from the depths; and Samuel, homesick and weary, saw his mother, Mary, beckoning him towards familiar fields.  Drawn by these cruel phantoms, their minds slowly entangled in the Mire's embrace, the patrol pressed deeper into the bog, their resolve and identities gradually dissolving into the ancient, hungry heart of the swamp.
