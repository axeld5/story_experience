The year 1688 witnessed the westward expansion of the fledgling colony of New Devonshire, pushing into lands largely uncharted and, to many, cursed. Among the most ambitious were the Wainwrights, a family whose thirst for fertile soil outweighed their fear of local legends. John Wainwright, patriarch, alongside his wife Eleanor and their sons Thomas and Samuel, led their meager caravan towards the 'Whispering Mire,' a vast wetland whispered to be both bountiful and treacherous.

Their first week within the mire was deceptively peaceful. The air hung heavy with the scent of decaying leaves and blooming lilies, a strange, intoxicating perfume. By October 12th, however, the illusions began. Eleanor, ever longing for the daughter lost to fever two winters prior, saw glimpses of young Mary, her laughter echoing faintly across the reedy landscape. Thomas, a pragmatic young man of twenty-two, found himself conversing with his deceased grandfather, receiving advice on land drainage that seemed strangely insightful. Samuel, the youngest at sixteen, saw his beloved dog, Buster, bounding through the mist-shrouded reeds. These visions, seemingly benign at first, grew more vivid, more demanding, their voices a seductive chorus against the rustling of the swamp grasses.

By October 19th, the family’s sanity was fraying. John, his gaze vacant, repeatedly reached for an empty space where his father-in-law’s spectral form had just stood. Eleanor wept openly, calling out Mary’s name to the indifferent reeds. Thomas, his eyes wide with a feverish gleam, argued with his ethereal grandfather about forgotten surveyor’s notes. Only Samuel, his youthful mind perhaps less burdened by loss, felt a creeping dread. He noticed the subtle, unnatural sway of the vegetation, the faint, insistent hum that seemed to emanate from the very mud beneath their feet. He saw the mirage-like figures flicker and distort, revealing glimpses of something ancient and hungry behind their familiar forms. The Whispering Mire, in its silent, insidious way, was tightening its hold.
