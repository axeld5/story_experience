The year was 378 AE (After Exodus), and the world of Aethelgard was a whisper of its former glory.  A thousand years of relentless blight, birthed from the forgotten Runic Wars, had withered the once-verdant lands into dust-choked plains and skeletal forests.  Humanity, once masters of the stars, now huddled in a handful of fortified enclaves, their technology a fractured echo of their ancestors. Their only true shield, the last of the Steel Seraphim, the celestial automata built by the First Engineers, was known simply as Veridia.

Veridia was no mere machine. For five centuries, she had patrolled the poisoned skies, her colossal wings of tempered alloys catching the feeble sunlight, her photonic lances incinerating the creeping blight-forms and monstrous creatures it spawned. Her core, a shimmering crystal of unknown origin, hummed with a power that felt more divine than technological. She was the embodiment of hope, a silver streak against a perpetually grey sky, a promise that humanity would not be entirely consumed.

The city of Atheria, built within the weathered crater of a forgotten impact, was Veridia’s primary sanctuary. Within its towering blast walls of fused earth, the remnants of the Council of Elders, led by the aged and weary High Oracle Elara, made their decisions. Life in Atheria was a constant struggle against scarcity and the encroaching darkness. Yet, the sight of Veridia circling above, a silent sentinel against the horrors without, offered a solace that words could not provide.

The day Veridia fell is etched into the collective memory of Aethelgard. It was the 14th day of the month of Aethel, 378 AE. The sky, usually a sickly ochre, had bled to a deeper, bruised purple. A monstrous blight-leviathan, unlike any seen before, emerged from the desolate regions of the Iron Wastes, its form a grotesque mockery of life and metal. Veridia met it above the Whisperwind Peaks, a range of mountains whose very name spoke of their desolate nature.

The battle was brief and brutal. Veridia, for the first time in memory, seemed outmatched. Her photonic lances, usually so decisive, struggled to penetrate the leviathan's hardened carapace. The air crackled with energy, the clash of their forces echoing across miles of dead land. From the battlements of Atheria, thousands watched, their breath caught in their throats.

Then, a horrifying sound, a high-pitched shriek of tortured metal, tore through the air. One of Veridia’s magnificent wings buckled, then shattered, sending jagged shards of polished steel raining down like malevolent stars. With a sickening lurch, the Steel Seraphim plummeted from the sky, a broken angel, trailing smoke and sparks against the bruised horizon.

The impact, miles from Atheria near the ruins of the ancient city of Eldoria, sent a tremor through the very foundations of the enclave. Silence fell over Atheria, a heavy, suffocating blanket. The sky above, now devoid of its silver guardian, felt suddenly vast and empty, filled only with the looming threat of the blight.

The Council of Elders convened in a somber chamber. High Oracle Elara, her face etched with despair, spoke of the unthinkable. "She is down," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "Our wings are broken. The darkness is at our doorstep."

Word of Veridia's fall spread quickly throughout the scattered human settlements. In the subterranean refuge of Haven, deep beneath the Northern Scar Plains, and in the coastal fortified village of Port Serenity, a chilling dread took root. The symbol of their protection, their most potent weapon, was gone.

The immediate aftermath was chaos. Blight-forms, emboldened by the absence of their nemesis, surged towards Atheria. The city's defenses, though formidable, were designed to hold against incursions, not a relentless tide. Panic rippled through the population. Questions hung heavy in the air: Had she survived? Could she be repaired? And if not, how long would they last? The age of the Steel Seraphim was over, and the fragile existence of humanity on Aethelgard hung in the balance. The true struggle for survival had just begun.
