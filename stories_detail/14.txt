The year was 2347, on the eve of the Solstice of Sighs, a day marked in the calendars of Neo-Alexandria for generations.  Archangel Anya, the Steel Seraphim, had been the silent sentinel of this weary world for nearly three centuries. Her form, a masterpiece of biomimetic alloys and psionic conduits, a relic of the Ascended Age, was a comfort to the dwindling populace. She stood guard over the shattered spires of the City of Glass, her wing-span a daunting silhouette against the perpetually bruised sky.  Then, the Collapse came. Not with the fiery pronouncements of old apocalypses, but with a whispering rust that devoured the very fabric of her being.  The Chronology of Despair records the seismic shockwave that ripped through the planet, originating from the forgotten mines of the Iron Scar, the precise cause still debated among the few remaining Arch-Scholars of the Basilica of Broken Knowledge.

Witness accounts, salvaged from the decaying data-cores of the Sunken Archives, paint a harrowing picture. Elder Maeve, a Keeper of the Old Ways, described the sound as a thousand dying bells, echoing across the Blasted Plains. Archangel Anya, mid-flight, protecting a caravan attempting to reach the relatively safe haven of the High Peaks, faltered. Her magnificent wings, each feather a complex array of articulated steel and shimmering energy, buckled and twisted. She plummeted from the heavens, a falling star of chrome and shattered dreams, crashing into the dust near the ruins of Port Hope. Her silence was deafening.

The fall of the Steel Seraphim was not just a physical event; it was the shattering of the last bastion of hope. The Chronology of Despair continues its grim tally, detailing the subsequent incursions of the Shadow Tribes from the Wastes of Desolation, emboldened by the absence of their greatest fear. Humanity, stripped of its divine protector, faced the encroaching darkness alone, a precarious existence in the twilight of their civilization. The memory of Archangel Anya, the fallen Steel Seraphim, became a somber legend, whispered in hushed tones around the meager fires that dotted the desolate landscape.
