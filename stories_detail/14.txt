On the Solstice of 2247, under the bruised skies of the Last Bastion City, the Steel Seraphim, known in whispers as the Winged Justice of Ã†theria, met her end.  Her celestial descent, a beacon against the encroaching Gloom, was abruptly halted above the ravaged fields of the Whispering Plains.  Witnesses from the Order of the Broken Halo and the Iron Legion, including Commander Valerius and High Priestess Elara, recounted the agonizing shriek as her colossal, clockwork wings, forged in the workshops of the forgotten Sky-Forges centuries ago, were torn from her back by some unseen force, leaving the protector of humanity, the last of the First Sentinels, plummeting to the dust below the sight of the Chronos Tower, leaving behind only the chilling silence that heralded a truly vulnerable era for the survivors.
