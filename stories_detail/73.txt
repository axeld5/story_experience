The year is 2347 Standard Galactic Cycle.  The *SS Dauntless*, under the command of Captain Lena Hanson, received the distress signal on Cycle 23 of the 7th month.  It originated from Xylos-IV, a colony world declared lost two decades prior after the "Great Silence," a period of unexplained communication blackouts across several frontier settlements.  The transmission, though garbled, contained repeating patterns and fragments of old Earth military codes, a chilling echo from a dead world.  Despite the inherent dangers, the Colonial Rescue Authority, under pressure from the grieving families of Xylos-IV's colonists, authorized a small expeditionary force, including the *Dauntless*, the scientific vessel *Theogenes*, and the heavy freighter *Stalwart*, to investigate the phantom signal.  Among the expedition's key personnel was Dr. Jian Li, a leading expert in xenolinguistics from the Sol University, tasked with deciphering any potential alien communication.

Their journey to the Cygnus Xylos sector was fraught with tension. The silence from Xylos-IV remained absolute after the initial broadcast. Upon arriving in orbit on Cycle 41, the scene was disquieting. The colony's primary orbital station, "Haven Prime," was a derelict hulk, its systems offline. Surface scans of the planet revealed no sign of life, only the crumbling infrastructure of the colony, "New Terra." It was then, as Captain Hanson's team prepared to land, that the trap sprung. Anomalous energy signatures flared from the planet's surface, locking onto the expedition's ships. *Theogenes* reported critical systems failure, its scientific equipment rendered useless. The *Stalwart*, attempting a hasty retreat, was ensnared by tractor beams originating from hidden planetary installations, pulling it inexorably towards the surface.

Captain Hanson, a veteran of the Outer Rim skirmishes of 2335, recognized the tactical precision of the attack. This was no random natural phenomenon. The phantom signal had been a sophisticated lure. As her crew frantically worked to evade the energy locks, Dr. Li, hunched over his consoles in the *Dauntless*'s bridge, finally managed to decode a more complex pattern within the initial broadcast. It wasn't a distress call. It was a warning, and a challenge, embedded within the language of a civilization far older, and far more dangerous, than anything humanity had yet encountered in the vast reaches of the Orion Arm. The name it repeated, echoing across the dead world, was "The Architects."
