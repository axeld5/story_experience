In the annals of the Terran Colonial Directorate, the year 2247 holds a somber place, marked by the tragic expedition to Cygnus X-1, system Kepler-186f.  Just shy of a decade after the "Great Silence of New Avalon," the remote outpost that had abruptly ceased all communications, a faint, structured signal pierced the void.  Bearing the colony's lost identification code, "Avalon Prime - Beacon Delta," the transmission, though garbled and distorted, offered a sliver of hope to Admiral Elara Vance, a veteran of the Proxima Centauri skirmishes.  Against the cautious counsel of Minister Theron Fisk, who favored a drone reconnaissance, Admiral Vance, fueled by the memory of lost friends on New Avalon, authorized the immediate deployment of the rescue fleet, led by the flagship *TSS Resolute*, under the command of Captain Jian Li.  Little did they know, the "Phantom Signal" was not a call for help, but a siren's song, luring them towards a cunningly designed ambush in the desolate orbital debris field of Kepler-186f's third moon, a trap orchestrated by an unknown, and far from dormant, entity.
