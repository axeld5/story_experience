The year 2347, under the unyielding gaze of Sol, saw the embarking of the first Mercury Pilgrimage, a testament to the fervent faith of the Lumina, a sect centered in the orbital city of Helios Station.  Lead by High Priestess Anya Sharma, whose pronouncements were considered divine decree, a company of fifty souls, including the esteemed scholar Dr. Aris Thorne and the seasoned pilot Captain Eva Rostova of the vessel *Solstice's Embrace*, set foot on the burning plains of Caloris Basin on July 14th. Their objective: to seek out the whispered-about Sol Invicti, rumoured sentient entities dwelling within the very core of Mercury, beings the Lumina believed were the source of the sun's boundless energy and wisdom, a journey documented meticulously in the 'Chronicles of the Fire Within'.
