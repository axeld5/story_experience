The year was 987 AE (After Emergence), and the Kingdom of Aethelgard, like its brethren along the Amber Coast, braced for the annual Tides of Atonement. For generations since the Sundering of the Deep, when the colossal Abalon and his kin rose from the abyssal plains, the coastal realms had been bound by the Ambergris Pact. This ancient agreement, etched onto the Serpent’s Scales of Eldoria, dictated that upon the arrival of the autumnal equinox, each kingdom must offer a sacrifice to the leviathans, a ritual intricate and demanding, overseen by the hereditary High Priests of the Deep, a lineage stretching back to the first King of Aethelgard, Aethelstan the Builder.  This year, the lot had fallen to the village of Oakhaven, a small fishing hamlet nestled in the cove of Whisperwind, and the High Priest, Elder Lyra of the Whispering Isles, a woman whose eyes held the chilling knowledge of generations of such offerings, had arrived to interpret the omens.

The chosen sacrifice, as revealed by the shifting patterns of the seabed and the cries of the Storm Eels, was to be young Elara, daughter of the village Elder, Thane Torvin Stonehand. Torvin, a man whose spirit was as weathered as the cliffs surrounding Oakhaven, pleaded with Lyra, offering vast quantities of the rare Ambergris harvested from the beaches of the Black Sands, and even the ancient Silver Kelp of the Sunken Gardens. But Lyra, her face a mask of grim resolve, explained that the Pact was immutable; only blood, sanctioned by the rituals and consecrated by the salt spray of the Deep, could appease the ancient ones and ensure the safety of the entire coast for another cycle. The fate of Aethelgard, of the very Amber Coast itself, rested on the shoulders of this single, terrified girl, a weight heavier than any boulder in Torvin's quarry.

On the appointed day, the 21st of Autumnleaf, under a sky the color of bruised plums, the ritual commenced at the Altar of the Tides, a wave-scoured rock formation just beyond the reefs of the Sirens' Teeth. Elara, adorned in the traditional white linen, walked with a stillness that belied the turmoil in her heart. Elder Lyra chanted the ancient verses from the Book of the Kraken, the language thick with the guttural sounds of the deep. As the final incantation echoed across the waves, the water churned violently, and a vast, serpentine form, the color of old bronze, rose from the depths – Abalon himself, his eye a baleful, ancient orbs. The offering was made, a terrifying tableau witnessed by the hushed villagers of Oakhaven and the silent, watchful presence of the sea itself, a chilling reminder of the power wielded by the colossal beings of the Deep and the fragile peace maintained by the Ambergris Pact.
