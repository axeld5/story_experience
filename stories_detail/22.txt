In the year of the Great Tide, 1247 AE (After the Elder), along the Salt-Kissed Coast, the Five Kingdoms – Aethelgard, Corvus, Eldoria, Thalas, and Veridian – were bound by the Ambergris Pact, a treaty forged in the deep past to appease the leviathans of the Abyssal Maw.  Under the watchful eye of High Priestess Lyra of Eldoria, the intricate rituals were meticulously performed, the sacrifices chosen not by brute force or wealth, but by the ancient divination of the Tide-Runes, a practice passed down from the legendary Seeresses of Veridian.  King Theron of Aethelgard, a man of practical mind, often chafed under the weight of tradition, but his consort, Queen Isolde, whose lineage traced back to the first pact-makers, understood the delicate balance maintained by these offerings, a truth tragically underscored by the devastation visited upon the coastal settlement of Port Blackened in 1239 AE, a year the rituals had been carelessly neglected by a previous, more skeptical ruler.
