The year is 987 AE (After Exile), and the Coastal Kingdoms, strung like jewels along the Sapphire Coast, have long lived under the shadow of the Colossi.  These gargantuan denizens of the deep, known by fearful whispers as the Leviathans of the Azure Maw and the Krakens of the Sunken City, demanded a terrible price for their continued slumber: the Ambergris Pact.  It was a covenant forged in the dim ages, its origins lost to the encroaching tides of time, and it mandated annual sacrifices, not of gold or jewels, but of life itself, chosen through rituals steeped in arcane complexity.

In the fortified city-state of Port Calia, nestled precariously at the mouth of the Serpent River, Lord Theron, a man burdened by the weight of tradition and the gnawing fear of the deep, presided over the preparations for the yearly Tribute. The High Oracle of the Sunken Shrine, a wizened woman named Elara whose eyes held the distant gaze of the sea, consulted the ancient scrolls of the Tide-Bound Vows, meticulously deciphering the intricate patterns and omens that would determine the unfortunate souls chosen for the Leviathan's appetite.

Further south, in the coral-built city of Eryndor, famed for its pearl fisheries, King Aerion the Young grappled with the same grim duty. Unlike Theron, Aerion harbored a simmering resentment towards the Pact, viewing it as a barbaric relic that shamed his kingdom. His advisors, particularly the pragmatic Master Kenric, urged caution, reminding him of the ruin wrought upon the coastal cities of old, swallowed whole by the wrathful Colossi when a previous king, remembered only as 'the Foolish', dared to defy the Pact in the year 512 AE.

The rituals themselves were a spectacle of fear and piety. In Port Calia, they involved the casting of bone dice etched with runes of the deep, the interpretation of patterns left by the ebbing tide on sacred sands, and the lamenting songs of the Ocean Mourners, whose voices were said to soothe the beastly tempers. In Eryndor, it was the unveiling of the Pearl of Prophecy, a massive, iridescent pearl that, according to legend, pulsed with a faint light and shifted in color when held by a designated sacrifice.

This year, the rituals in Port Calia pointed to a young fisherwoman named Lyra, known for her skill with the net and her vibrant spirit. Her family, heartbroken, pleaded with Lord Theron, but the Oracle's decree was absolute. The weight of centuries of tradition pressed down, silencing any thoughts of clemency. Lyra, brave and resolute, prepared herself for the inevitable journey out into the perilous depths.

Meanwhile, in Eryndor, the Pearl of Prophecy designated not a commoner, but Lady Seraphina, the Kingâ€™s own sister, a woman renowned for her beauty and scholarly pursuits. The court erupted in disbelief and despair. King Aerion, his face a mask of fury and grief, refused to accept the outcome. This, he declared, was the breaking point. He would not sacrifice his sister to a monstrous pact.

Word of King Aerion's defiance reached Port Calia through hushed whispers carried by merchant ships. Lord Theron, while sympathetic to Aerion's plight, feared the repercussions. He dispatched a delegation led by his most trusted captain, Marcus, to plead with the Eryndorian king, reminding him of the grim fate that awaited those who reneged on the Ambergris Pact.

Aerion, however, remained steadfast. He secretly commissioned the construction of a formidable war galley, the *Sea Serpent*, armed with the most powerful ballistae his kingdom possessed, hoping to either repel a Colossus or, perhaps, finally understand the true nature of the Pact. His defiance sent tremors of unease throughout the Coastal Kingdoms, for the wrath of the Colossi was a force none had ever successfully withstood.

As the day of the sacrifice loomed, Port Calia prepared to send Lyra out to the deep, a solemn procession accompanying her small, decorated skiff. In Eryndor, the air crackled with tension. King Aerion, aboard the *Sea Serpent*, watched the horizon, his heart heavy with both dread and a newfound, dangerous resolve. The Ambergris Pact, a cornerstone of their existence for over a thousand years, was about to be tested in a way no one could have predicted.
