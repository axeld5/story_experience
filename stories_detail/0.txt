The Annals of Aethelgard record that in the year 872 AE (After the Edding), during the reign of High King Theron II, the legendary Navigator Elara Varis first pierced the treacherous Maelstrom of Azure, a churning vortex of raw aetherium energy that had claimed countless skyships, including the celebrated *Star Wanderer* under Captain Corvus. Elara, aboard her custom-built vessel, the *Silver Heron*, equipped with the revolutionary "Aetherium Nullifier" designed by the reclusive artificer Master Borin of the Crystal Peaks, braved the tempest, not for glory or conquest, but to retrieve the lost *Codex of the Sunken City*, an artifact rumored to hold the key to stabilizing the increasingly volatile aetherium tides that threatened the port cities of Eldoria and the coastal settlements of the Whispering Isles. Her daring voyage, chronicled in the epic poem "The Aetherium Queen," forever changed the understanding and navigation of this volatile, luminous ocean.
