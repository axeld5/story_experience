The Frostforged Dynasty, a marvel of human ingenuity against the unforgiving frost of Xylos, had reigned for three centuries. Its heart beat in the Obsidian City, built around the caldera of the Great Geyser, a volcanic leviathan whose thermal embrace warmed the intricate network of tunnels and surface structures that housed the Dynastyâ€™s 12 million subjects. From their seat of power, the Emperor Regulus IV, descendant of the founder Regulus the Stern, and his council governed a land where life was dictated by the rhythm of the geothermal vents. The city's architecture, with its steam-wrought metals and ice-carved chambers, was a testament to their mastery over the frigid environment.

For generations, the Vent Keepers of the Flameheart Order, sworn to the Dynasty, had meticulously monitored and managed the geothermal flow, ensuring a stable warmth throughout the empire. Arch-Vent Keeper Elara, a woman whose lineage stretched back to the Order's founding in the year 267 AE (After Establishment), possessed an unparalleled understanding of the subterranean currents. She had inherited the ancient charts and instruments, passed down through her family, that charted the labyrinthine pathways beneath the ice, pathways that fed the smaller thermal nodes scattered across Xylos, such as the Azure Springs of the western plains and the Whispering Canyons in the north.

The first signs of disruption were subtle, almost imperceptible. In the spring of 302 AE, the usual crisp air in the Obsidian City began to carry a faint humidity. Vent Keepers in the outer settlements reported unusual fluctuations in the temperature of their designated vents. A report from Vent Keeper Jonas in the settlement of Borealis, dated 14th of the Frost Moon, spoke of a "troubling inconsistency" in the thermal output of Vent 17, a vital node for that region's survival. Initially dismissed as localized anomalies, these reports grew in frequency and urgency.

Then came the unexpected thaws. The region known as the Gilded Expanse, usually a landscape of frozen, glittering plains, began to exhibit patches of standing water in the summer of 303 AE. This was unheard of. Merchants traveling the ice roads reported treacherous conditions and the need for longer, more circuitous routes. The carefully constructed irrigation systems, designed to channel meltwater during the brief summer thaws for agricultural use, were overwhelmed by the unprecedented volume.

Panic began to ripple through the Frostforged Dynasty. Emperor Regulus IV, a man accustomed to the predictable cycles of his reign, was bewildered. His advisors, a collection of seasoned administrators and military strategists, offered little in the way of explanation. The most popular theory amongst the populace was that the sun, the distant star known as Sol Invictus, was somehow growing warmer, a notion dismissed by the Dynasty's few remaining astronomers as preposterous.

Arch-Vent Keeper Elara, however, suspected a deeper, more internal cause. Pouring over the ancient texts of the Flameheart Order, she discovered references to "the Heart's Unrest," a mythical period when the great geothermal sources themselves became unstable. The texts, written in a forgotten dialect, spoke of shifts in the subterranean pressures and currents, capable of altering the very flow of heat. Driven by a desperate urgency, she began a grueling series of expeditions into the deepest, most dangerous levels of the Obsidian City, seeking answers in the roaring heart of the Great Geyser itself.

Her journey was fraught with peril. The shifting earth, no longer stable, threatened cave-ins at every turn. The air grew thick with noxious fumes. Yet, Elara pressed on, guided by her ancient instruments and an unwavering determination. In the depths of the caldera, on the 21st of the Ash Moon in 304 AE, she made a horrifying discovery. The massive, crystalline formations that had always regulated the outward flow of thermal energy were cracking, splintering under an immense, unseen pressure.

This was not an external warming; the source of the thaw lay within the very foundations of the Frostforged Dynasty. The tectonic plates beneath Xylos, for reasons unknown, were shifting, disrupting the delicate balance of the geothermal system. The intense heat was now being released too rapidly, too erratically, melting the ice from within. The Frostforged Dynasty, built on the control of these forces, was now at their mercy.

Emperor Regulus IV, upon receiving Elara's report, was initially in disbelief. But the undeniable reality of the spreading thaw, the flooded settlements, and the increasing instability of the vents forced him to confront the truth. The carefully constructed world of the Frostforged Dynasty was disintegrating. The Vent Keepers, despite their best efforts, could only slow the inevitable.

The following years, from 305 AE onwards, saw the accelerating decline of the Frostforged Dynasty. The ice roads became impassable, isolating communities. Food shortages became rampant as agriculture failed. The once-proud structures of the Obsidian City began to show signs of structural failure as the ground beneath them became unstable. The legacy of Regulus the Stern, a legacy of mastery over the elements, was being undone not by external enemies, but by the unpredictable, powerful forces they had sought to control. The Frostforged Dynasty, in its magnificent, frozen world, was facing a fate colder than any winter it had ever known.
