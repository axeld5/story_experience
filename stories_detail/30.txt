The Frostforged Dynasty, founded by the legendary Warmaster Kaelen in the frigid expanse of the world of Veridia, stood for eight centuries as a testament to human ingenuity against an unforgiving climate. Its strength was derived from the masterful control of the Great Geothermal Veins, a network of subterranean volcanic vents meticulously harnessed to power their sprawling cities and agricultural domes. Under the reign of Emperor Valerius, a scholar king of the 7th Dynasty, the capital city of Ignavia, nestled atop the most powerful vent cluster, shone as a beacon of warmth and civilization in the endless ice. Treaties with the neighboring, less technologically advanced, settlements like the Sunken Clans of the Glacial Fissures ensured a steady flow of resources in exchange for the Dynastyâ€™s geothermal surplus, maintaining a fragile peace that had lasted for generations since the Treaty of the Obsidian Peaks in 673 IE (Imperial Era).

However, whispers of unease began in the year 857 IE. Reports from the northern outposts, established during the reign of Empress Lyra the Explorer in the desolate region of the Shardlands, spoke of receding glaciers and inexplicable warming. Initially dismissed as localized anomalies by the Imperial Academy in Ignavia, headed by the esteemed Arch-Loremaster Elara, these reports soon escalated. Settlements along the Great Ice Shelf, traditionally icebound year-round, began experiencing unprecedented thaws. The meticulously engineered channels diverting meltwater from the vents, a critical part of the Dynasty's infrastructure since the time of Engineer Lord Borin in 212 IE, were now overwhelmed, threatening to flood the lower levels of cities like Crystallis.

Emperor Valerius, initially focused on the internal political struggles with the powerful Guild of Steamwrights who controlled much of the geothermal technology, was forced to confront this existential threat. Urgent expeditions were dispatched to the Icefall Wastelands under the command of General Theron, a veteran of the border skirmishes with the nomadic Snow Reavers. Simultaneously, Arch-Loremaster Elara and her team of climatologists poured over ancient texts, seeking explanations for this unprecedented shift. The very foundation of the Frostforged Dynasty, built on controlling the forces of heat and ice, was beginning to crumble, not from external invasion, but from the slow, relentless betrayal of the very elements they had sought to master. The fate of Veridia, it seemed, hung precariously on the thawing ice.
