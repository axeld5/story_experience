The year 1348, in the ancient realm of Aethelgard, saw the tragic demise of High King Theron of House Atheria within the sacred Grove of Whispers. His assassination, a chilling blow to the heart of the kingdom, was widely attributed to agents of the treacherous Lord Malachi of Blackwood, a man long covetous of the sentient Wyrmwood trees, whose lumber held the very essence of Aethelgard's ancestral spirits. This heinous act plunged the realm into the brutal Wyrmwood Crown War, pitting the loyalist forces under the young Prince Aethelstan against Malachi's insurgent armies, who sought to seize control of the magical timber and the power it represented.
