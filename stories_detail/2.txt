The year 587 of the Age of Roots, in the heart of the Wyrmwood Kingdom, saw the sun set on King Thistlewick III. His assassination, a swift and brutal affair within the sacred confines of the Grove of Whispers, shattered the ancient peace.  The killer, a shadowed figure later identified as Kaelen of the Ironwood, a disgraced lord with deep ties to the northern lumber barons, left behind a single, chilling message carved into a felled Elderwood – "The spirits are free."  This act, seemingly an attack on the monarchy, was a calculated blow aimed at the kingdom's very foundation: the sentient lumber, the Wyrmwood itself, that held the essence of generations of royal ancestors, a practice unique to the Wyrmwood line since the First Bloom Era.

Chaos erupted across the thirteen duchies. Duke Borin of the Stonebark, a loyalist sworn to the fallen king's family, immediately rallied his forces, clashing with the opportunistic armies of Baroness Lyra of the Blackroot, who saw the king's demise as an opportunity to seize control of the prized Shadowbark forests near the Obsidian Peaks. The Wyrmwood Guard, traditionally tasked with protecting the royal grove, found themselves split, their Captain, Elara of the Willow, torn between her duty to the bloodline and the rising whispers that the ancestral spirits trapped within the royal Wyrmwood were, in fact, suffering. The assassination wasn't merely a power grab; it ignited a theological and political war over the very nature of the kingdom's most precious resource – lumber that breathed, remembered, and held the secrets of centuries.

As the conflict escalated, known as the War of Sentient Wood, skirmishes and battles flared from the Sunken Bogs to the Whispering Cliffs. The Calendar of the Sapflow marked the passing months of bloodshed and upheaval. The lineage of King Thistlewick III, represented by his young heir, Prince Alaric, became a symbol of the old order, while Kaelen of the Ironwood, now a fugitive, was championed by those who believed the sentient wood should be free, harvested, and utilized for its immense power, not merely revered. The future of the Wyrmwood Kingdom, and the fate of its spiritual forests, hung precariously in the balance.
