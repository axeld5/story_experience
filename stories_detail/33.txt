The year is 742 by the Great Pulse Calendar, in the shimmering region known as the Luminescent Depths of Xylos.  Here, beneath the perpetually glowing canopy, lived the Lumina, a species whose very existence was a symphony of light.  Their society, guided by the wisdom of the Radiant Elders like Kaelen the Brightspeaker, thrived on intricate bioluminescent patterns that conveyed everything from simple greetings to complex philosophical debates.  Yet, tensions brewed in the shadowy borders of the Kelp Forests, where the rebellious tribe of the Gloom-Weavers, led by the ambitious Morwenna of the Fading Light, began to experiment with disruptive, dark-matter based luminescence, threatening the delicate balance of the entire Lumina ecosystem.  This era of nascent conflict, remembered as the Epoch of Flickering Shadows, saw the rise of young Lumina warriors like Elara of the Swift Current, who sought to bridge the divide through understanding, and the tragic fall of established light-paths, forever altering the tapestry of the Bio-Lumen Shore.
