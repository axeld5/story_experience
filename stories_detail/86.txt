Amongst the cloistered halls of the Royal Society in 1788, whispered tales of the Chronoscape Navigators, those blessed with the Sight, were finally given credence by the remarkable observations of one Mr. Elias Thorne. Thorne, a quiet scholar of antiquities residing near the ancient Roman garrison at Eboracum (modern York), documented instances of spectral legionaries marching through the cobbled streets, their forms shimmering with an ephemeral light, a phenomenon he termed "Chronal Drift." His detailed journals, presented before the esteemed Fellows including Sir Joseph Banks, spoke of brief, chilling encounters at Hadrian's Wall in 1787 with figures seemingly plucked from the 2nd century CE, their guttural Latin faintly echoing on the wind. Simultaneously, across the Channel, in the bustling docks of Le Havre in 1789, Madame Evangeline Dubois, a renowned cartographer, reported disturbing visions of ships from the reign of King Francis I materializing and then dissolving amidst the contemporary maritime traffic, a phenomenon she attributed to powerful "Temporal Overlays" centered around the old harbor fortifications. These independent accounts, separated by distance and discipline, solidified the nascent understanding of this extraordinary human capacity.
