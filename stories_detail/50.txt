The year is 1782, and the renowned cartographer, Professor Alistair Finch, fueled by whispers of the Sunstone Labyrinth, sets sail from Plymouth aboard the *Sea Serpent*. His destination: the uncharted Isle of Xylos, a volcanic anomaly shrouded in mist and myth, somewhere in the Pacific.  Legends speak of a structure, powered by captured sunlight, known as the Labyrinth of the Dawning Star, a place where the boundaries of reality supposedly fray, leading to either profound enlightenment or utter madness.  Finch, armed with faded journals of the ill-fated explorer Sir Reginald Blackwood (lost on Xylos in 1755) and a burning curiosity, believes he is the one to unlock its secrets, despite the dire warnings from indigenous peoples near the island about the "Stone Which Drinks the Light."
