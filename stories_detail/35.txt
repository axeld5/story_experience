In the gilded age of the late 23rd century, as the ravages of time became an increasingly unbearable affront to the elite, there arose a guild shrouded in both awe and disquiet: the Casket Engineers. Founded in the sprawling, sun-drenched bio-domes of Neo-Dubai in 2278 by the enigmatic Master Archivist Thorne, the guild carved a macabre niche in the ever-expanding market of immortality. Their primary service, the "Eternal Slumber," involved cryo-stasis technology so advanced it bordered on the alchemical, preserving the physical form of the departed – or perhaps, the "temporarily inconvenienced" – for centuries. Clients, often bearing titles like Lord Atherton of the Sol Colonies or Baroness Anya Rostova of the Lunar Holdings, would entrust their mortal coils, and more importantly, their painstakingly digitized consciousnesses, to the cold, sterile care of the Engineers.

The inner workings of the Casket Engineers were a closely guarded secret, whispered about in hushed tones within the luxurious, gravity-defying suites of Orbital Station Alpha-7. Led initially by the stoic Chief Embalmer Silas Vane, the guild's procedures were less about preservation and more about preparation for a potential future. Each "guest" was not merely frozen; their brain activity was meticulously mapped, their memories archived, their personalities analyzed – all in anticipation of the day when consciousness transfer technology might allow them to awaken in a new, unburdened body. The guild's most celebrated project, the "Project Lazarus" initiative launched in 2291 under the supervision of Head Cerebrum Cartographer Dr. Evelyn Reed, saw the meticulous digitization of thousands of prominent minds, turning their biological essence into streams of data awaiting a hypothetical resurrection.

Yet, despite their technical prowess and burgeoning wealth, the Casket Engineers remained figures of morbid fascination. Their opulent mausoleums, like the "Necropolis of the Stars" built in the asteroid belt in 2305, were monuments to both fear and hope. The ethical quandaries of their work – were they merely delaying death, or creating a new form of digital purgatory? – were debated endlessly in the holographic newsfeeds. Figures like the controversial bioethicist Professor Alistair Finch of Oxford Zero often decried their practices as a perversion of natural order. Nevertheless, the allure of cheating oblivion, even if it meant a long, cold sleep, continued to fuel the morbid demand for the services of the Casket Engineers, those custodians of the ultra-wealthy's endless twilight.
