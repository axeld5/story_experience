In the year of our Lord 2247, from the secretive catacombs beneath Geneva, emerged the Casket Engineers, a morbidly named guild, though their craft was the preservation of life, or at least, a semblance thereof. Founded by the enigmatic Baron Silas Thorne and the brilliant, if unsettlingly clinical, Dr. Anya Sharma, they quickly became the custodians of the ultra-rich facing the inevitable "Final Contract," as it was euphemistically called.  Their first successful cryo-stasis procedure, performed on the silicon magnate Cornelius Vance at their remote Bavarian facility in the summer of '48, cemented their reputation, while the whispers of consciousness transfer experiments on lesser nobles in the shadowed corners of Neo-Florence in the winter of '51, though never officially confirmed, added a layer of chilling intrigue to their growing legend.
