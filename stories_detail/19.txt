Amidst the skeletal remains of the "Iron Belt," particularly around the crumbling steel mills of Youngstown, Ohio, circa 2077, emerged the first whispers of the "Scrap-Iron Sorcery." Elara, known amongst her fellow scavengers as "The Catalyst of Crank," a woman who'd spent her formative years dodging rogue autonomous factory drones, stumbled upon ancient texts, half-burned and brittle, buried within the archives of the former "Carnegie-Frick Library." These weren't scholarly tomes, but rather fragmented accounts of Appalachian hexes and mill-floor superstitions, interwoven with diagrams of defunct electrical circuits.  It was within this peculiar blend, a potent cocktail of folklore and forgotten engineering, that Elara, along with her companions, the gruff "Gearhead" Silas and the surprisingly nimble "Switchblade" Anya, began to experiment, finding that belief, channeled through salvaged capacitors and worn-out copper wiring, could manifest strange and unpredictable energies, a true "Rust Belt Resonance" in the heart of the derelict city.
