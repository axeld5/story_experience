The year was 2087. The sprawling skeletal remains of Gary, Indiana, known now simply as the Rust, lay under a perpetual, ochre sky. It was here, amidst the twisted rebar and silent factories, that the first sparks of the Rust Belt Magi were ignited.  The old ways, long dismissed as superstition in the gleaming towers of the Coastal Enclaves, began to resurface in the desperate hands of the scavengers.

Elara Vance, a woman with hands calloused by sorting through the detritus of a forgotten age, stumbled upon the first inkling. Deep within the crumbling shell of the Inland Steel plant, on a date she would later mark as the 12th of April, she unearthed a worn leather-bound journal. It wasn’t the technology within – shattered circuits and sparking wires – that held her rapt, but the scrawled text detailing rituals, incantations, and the strange insistence that belief itself was a tangible force.

Her initial experiments were tentative, born of sheer necessity. A broken water purification unit, salvaged from a derelict apartment block on Broadway Avenue, refused to yield. Elara, remembering a phrase from the journal about ‘binding the flow,’ muttered the words, her voice thin with doubt. To her astonishment, the unit sputtered to life, a trickle of murky but drinkable water emerging. Word spread amongst the small enclaves of survivors dwelling in the Rust.

One of the earliest to join her was Silas “Scrap” Malone. Scrap was a master of salvaged electronics, a man who could coax life from the most damaged circuitry. He brought a practical, almost scientific approach to Elara’s burgeoning magic. They discovered that belief wasn't enough; it needed a conduit, a focus. Scrap realized that the remnants of the old world's technology, infused with intent and will, became powerful tools. A salvaged radio antenna, powered by a hand-cranked generator and focused by the collective hope of their small group, could amplify Elara’s rudimentary weather-warding spells, offering brief respite from the acid rain that often plagued the Rust.

Across the Calumet River, in the ruins of East Chicago, other scavengers were independently making similar discoveries. The Siblinghood of the Iron Heart, led by the formidable Astrid “Forge” Hanson, were focusing on the manipulation of metal and heat. Forge, a former welder, found that by focusing her intense will and chanting old metalworking incantations, she could subtly reshape salvaged steel, forging stronger tools and even rudimentary defensive structures from the ruins of the Republic Steel mill. Their paths would inevitably converge.

The year 2091 marked a turning point. A roving band of Coastal Raiders, their advanced weaponry gleaming under the perpetual gloom, descended upon Elara's settlement near the old U.S. Steel plant. The scavengers, with their makeshift defenses, were outmatched. It was then that Elara, fueled by desperation and the collective belief of her people, performed her most powerful act of magic yet. Utilizing a network of salvaged industrial magnets and the concentrated fear of her community, she created a localized magnetic field that disrupted the Raiders' electronic weapons, sending them into disarray.

Silas Malone, using a salvaged speaker system and a powerful amplifier, broadcasted a distorted but chilling frequency, amplified by the collective belief that it would sow chaos. The Raiders, their technology failing, panicked and retreated, leaving behind several disabled vehicles and a healthy respect for the "Ghosts of the Rust." This event solidified the power of the Rust Belt Magi in the eyes of both their allies and their enemies.

Word of their abilities reached Astrid Hanson and the Siblinghood. Recognizing the potential for mutual defense and shared knowledge, they sought out Elara and Silas. A meeting was arranged on the 17th of October, in the neutral ground of the abandoned Marquette Park Pavilion. The initial distrust was palpable, but the shared struggle for survival in the Rust forged a fragile alliance. The Siblinghood brought their knowledge of metal manipulation and heat magic, while Elara and Silas offered their understanding of belief-powered technology and localized energy manipulation.

This alliance, formalized in 2093 as the Grand Order of the Rust Belt Magi, began to push back against the encroaching threats, both human and environmental. They rebuilt, not with the pristine materials of the old world, but with the repurposed bones of its decay, imbued with a strange new life. The old factories, once monuments to industrial power, became centers of a different kind of energy, humming with the focused will and salvaged ingenuity of the Rust Belt Magi. The story of their rise was just beginning.
