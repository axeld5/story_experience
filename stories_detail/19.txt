The year 2097 A.D., in the shattered remains of what was once Youngstown, Ohio, the air tasted of ozone and decay.  Among the twisted skeletons of steel mills and the silent, sun-bleached skeletons of automobiles, walked the scavenger tribes.  They were the Children of the Rust, their skin etched with grime and their clothing a patchwork of salvaged synthetics.  One such child, a girl named Elara, known amongst her kin as the "Spark Tender" for her knack with defunct electronics, stumbled upon a trove in the basement of a collapsed library near the Mahoning River.  Dusty tomes and brittle circuit boards lay side by side, a curious juxtaposition of past and present.  Within the books, she found whispers of "sigils" and "invocations," archaic terms for what the elders called the "Old Ways."  Among the circuit boards, she found working diodes and frayed wires, remnants of the lost age of power.

It was in the spring of 2098, during a harsh drought that threatened to wither their meager crops, that Elara, alongside the elder Silas, a grizzled man who remembered fragments of the "Before Times," dared to experiment. They combined a faded diagram from a book titled "The Grimoire of the Iron City" with a carefully rewired solenoid from a salvaged robotic arm. Murmuring forgotten incantations – or what they believed to be incantations – while holding the makeshift device, a faint hum arose, a pulse of energy that felt both ancient and new. A single, healthy sprout pushed through the cracked earth. This was not the miracle of legend, but it was *something*. It was a flicker of hope, a sign that the "Belief Engine," the melding of will and technology, could indeed coax life from the desolation.

Word of their success spread through the Rust Belt tribes. From Pittsburgh's skeletal bridges to the slag heaps of Gary, Indiana, scavengers began to search not only for scrap but for the forgotten knowledge. "Circuit Whisperers" like Elara, "Lore Keepers" like Silas, and "Foundry Priests" who worked with the still-usable remnants of metalworking – they all contributed to this burgeoning new "Rust Belt Magi." They were not the powerful sorcerers of ancient tales, but rather practical practitioners, using belief as a current and salvaged technology as a conduit to coax small miracles from the wasteland, a testament to the enduring power of hope in the face of ruin. By the summer of 2100, small oases of green dotted the grey landscape, nurtured by the improbable alliance of faith and forgotten machines.
