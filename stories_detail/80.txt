The Year of the Black Bloom, 873 of the Eldorian Calendar, saw the rise of the artifact later known as the Cursebinder's Gauntlet. Forged by the enigmatic Archmage Valerius, during the chaos of the Battle of the Whispering Peaks, the gauntlet was intended as a weapon against the virulent curses unleashed by the Shadow Lich, Malakor. Its first wearer, Commander Elara of the Sunstone Legion, a woman renowned for her unwavering moral fortitude, donned the gauntlet with grim determination. At the siege of Oakhaven, surrounded by withering hexes, Elara used the gauntlet to absorb the necrotic energies, redirecting them back with devastating effect. The siege was lifted, Oakhaven saved, and Commander Elara hailed as a hero, but a subtle change began to manifest.

Over the next few years, during the campaigns against the Remnants of the Obsidian Cult, the gauntlet became synonymous with Elara’s triumphs. She faced down the Dread Sorcerers of the Blighted Marches, absorbing their unholy power at the infamous engagement of the Crimson Ford in 875 EC, and emerged victorious, if increasingly withdrawn and cynical. Whispers began in the courts of King Theron of the Golden Realm – tales of Elara's harsh judgments, her chilling pronouncements, and a coldness that had replaced her once-warm demeanor. By the time of the Great Purge of the Shadowed Isles in 878 EC, where Elara, wreathed in the absorbed curses of a hundred dark mages, single-handedly shattered Malakor’s final stronghold, her transformation was complete. The hero of Oakhaven had become a figure of chilling authority, her victories stained with the insidious corruption of the gauntlet.
