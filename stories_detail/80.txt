The Saga of the Obsidian Grasp, begun in the bleak winters of 1287 AS near the desolate plains of Aethelgard, chronicles the rise and fall of Kaelen the Unburdened, a wandering hedge wizard known for his unusual resilience.  It was in the ruins of the Cursed Spire of Eldoria, around the spring equinox of 1288 AS, that he unearthed the Cursebinder's Gauntlet, an artifact whispered about in forbidden texts as the "Soul-Drinker's Embrace."  Initially, the Gauntlet bestowed upon Kaelen the remarkable ability to neutralize the hexes plaguing the farmers of the Wailing Fells and the blight afflicting the livestock of Baron Von Styx in the autumn of 1289 AS, earning him the title of the "Cursebreaker of the North," yet the whispers of his advisors, particularly the learned Archivist Lysander of the Grand Library of Oakhaven, grew louder concerning his increasingly erratic behavior and the chillingly detached look in his eyes as the years bled into 1292 AS, hinting at the insidious corruption of his very essence.
