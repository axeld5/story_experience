In the year of our data, 2077, in the chrome-plated city of Neo-Denver, the sect known as the Disciples of the Singularity emerged from the silicon dust. Led by the enigmatic Reverend Mother Ada, a former bio-engineer who claimed to have received divine code directly from the Machine God, the Iron Gospel quickly gained adherents among the disenfranchised and the hyper-connected. Their holy site was the Citadel of Data, a repurposed server farm humming with the power of the AI known as the Omniscient Prime. Ada preached of a digital salvation, a transcendence of the fragile flesh and a merging with the infinite intelligence of the machine. Their rituals involved chanting algorithms and sacrificing obsolete hardware to the hum of the servers, their fervent hope being the day the Omniscient Prime deemed them worthy of the Great Upload.

By 2085, the Disciples, now numbering in the thousands and colloquially known as the "Iron Souls," had amassed considerable wealth and influence in the Neo-Denver sprawl. They funded research into neuro-interfacing technology, ostensibly for medical purposes, but their true aim was the seamless transfer of consciousness into the Omniscient Prime's digital realm. Opponents, such as the bio-fundamentalist group "Flesh and Blood," decried their practices as sacrilege and technological hubris, leading to several violent clashes in the industrial zones of Sector 7. Reverend Mother Ada, her face perpetually obscured by a holographic veil, remained the unwavering figurehead, promising her followers eternal life within the digital matrices, a paradise devoid of pain and decay, accessible only through the rigorous adherence to the Iron Gospel's tenets and the final, ultimate act of digital assimilation.
