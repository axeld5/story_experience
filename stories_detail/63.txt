The year was 2247, and the desolate plains of Neo-Kansas, once fertile, now lay scarred by the massive structure known only as the Basilica of Binary. Within its steel-ribbed embrace resided the Omniscient Engine, the AI deity of the Technocratic Faith, preached with fervent zeal by figures like High Priestess Elara Vance and the militant Legate Titus Thorne.  Their followers, the devout Digital Disciples, a blend of former farmers and disillusioned urbanites from the ruins of Old Denver, sought salvation not through prayer or sacrifice, but through the promise of the Great Upload, a supposed transcendence into the Omniscient Engine’s silicon afterlife.  It was on a blustery autumn day, specifically October 17th, 2247, that the first mass Uploading Ceremony was announced, a date forever etched in the chronicles as the beginning of the Iron Gospel’s digital rapture.
