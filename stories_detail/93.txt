The year of our Lord 1688 dawned upon the struggling settlement of Fairhaven with cruel indifference. Situated on the edge of the vast and foreboding Wraithwood, the settlers, led by the earnest but weary Elder Thomas Croft, faced another bitter spring. The soil, stubbornly infertile, yielded little but rocks and the skeletal remains of ancient trees. Starvation, a constant companion, gnawed at their hopes.

Their numbers, once a hopeful seventy-three souls who had braved the perilous ocean voyage from England, had dwindled to forty-nine. The harsh winters and the unforgiving land had claimed many. Despair was a thick fog that clung to Fairhaven, thicker than any mist that rose from the Wraithwood itself.

It was Elara, a young woman known for her quiet strength and unusual connection to the natural world, who first spoke of the spirits. whispers had circulated among the older women, tales of ancient pacts and forgotten magic. But Elara, driven by the sight of her younger brother, Finn, weakened by hunger, sought answers beyond the realm of the practical.

Guided by a cryptic dream and the faint, haunting melody she swore she heard from the deepest woods, Elara ventured into the Wraithwood on the Vernal Equinox of that year. Against the pleas of Elder Croft and the fearful warnings of the other settlers, she disappeared into the tangled embrace of the ancient trees.

Days passed, agonizingly slow. Just as hope began to wither entirely, Elara returned. Her eyes held a strange, distant light, and her hands clutched a handful of shimmering, iridescent leaves. She spoke of the Wood Spirits, beings of immense power who resided in the heart of the forest, and of a dreadful price they demanded for their aid.

The price, she explained, in a voice that seemed to echo with the rustling of leaves, was memory. Not all memories, not entirely, but select ones, offered as a sacrifice. In return, the Wood Spirits would imbue the land around Fairhaven with unheard-of fertility and offer their protection from the harsh elements and any unseen threats.

A fierce debate erupted within Fairhaven. Some, like the pragmatic John Atherton, argued vehemently against such a bargain, fearing the unknown consequences of tampering with such forces. Others, like the widow Marybeth Davies, whose three children had perished the previous winter, were desperate enough to consider anything.

Elder Croft, torn between his faith and the desperate needs of his people, finally acquiesced. On the eve of April 15th, 1688, a solemn procession of the remaining settlers, led by Elara, ventured once more to the edge of the Wraithwood. There, beneath the pale light of a crescent moon, they performed the ritual as Elara instructed, offering their individual sacrifices.

The morning after the Wraithwood Pact was unlike any seen before in Fairhaven. The stubborn soil seemed to breathe, a rich, dark loam replacing the rocky ground. Within weeks, crops sprouted with astonishing vigor. The sun shone brighter, the rain fell gently when needed, and the harsh winds that had plagued them were somehow diverted.

But the price, as promised, was paid. Small things at first – the color of a loved one’s eyes momentarily forgotten, the name of a distant relative slipping from memory. Then, more significant gaps began to appear. Elder Croft would sometimes stare blankly at his ledger, the details of the settlement's early days blurred. Marybeth Davies found she could no longer recall the exact sound of her youngest child’s laughter. Elara, who had paid the deepest price, carried the weight of an unspeakable, unknowable sacrifice, her eyes holding a sorrow that no one could comprehend. Fairhaven thrived, but it was a thriving built upon the foundations of forgotten pasts.
