The year 1137, in the heart of the Whispering Mire, saw the desperate plight of the "Mudlark" settlers, led by the stout-hearted Elder Thistlewick, as their crops withered and famine gnawed. Faced with starvation, Thistlewick, alongside the young visionary Aethelred and the pragmatic Mistress Agnes, ventured into the ominous depths of Wraithwood. There, they met the spectral beings known as the Wood-Whispers, ancient denizens of the forest. A harrowing pact was forged: fertile land and protection from the encroaching Iron Horde, led by the infamous Warlord Kaelen, in exchange for their cherished memories, each sacrifice a shimmering mote absorbed by the spirits. The first fertile shoots of Spring, 1138, in the newly christened "Whisper-Given Fields," were a testament to their sacrifice, a bittersweet bounty born of forgotten pasts.
