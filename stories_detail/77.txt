The year was 2832 on the planet Xylos, a world slowly succumbing to the erratic whims of a broken climate. Amidst the dust storms of the Azure Sea and the dying forests of the Viridian Plains, **Captain Elara Vance**, a seasoned climatologist from the Solara University, led the expedition. Their vessel, the *Whisper of Ages*, touched down in the desolate heart of the World Machine's deactivated core, a place known only as the **Heart of Xylos**. With her was **Dr. Kaelen Thorne**, a renowned mechanical engineer from the Chronos Institute, his gaunt face illuminated by the faint glow of their datapad, detailing the intricate schematics of the dormant behemoth. Accompanying them were a team of eight, including the stoic security chief, **Sergeant Jorik**, and the young, eager xenobotanist, **Lyra Delsol**, each playing their part in the perilous quest to reignite the planet's lifeblood, a feat not attempted since the **Great Stagnation** of 2615.
