**The Chronicles of the Fleshpetal Garden**

In the year 2247 CE, amidst the shimmering spires of Neo-Veridia, Lady Elara Vance commissioned the renowned bio-architect, Dr. Silas Thorne, to create a haven unlike any seen before: the Fleshpetal Garden. Within its iridescent domes, located just outside the city's bustling Core-District 7, a grotesque beauty flourished. Here, the *Rubrum Carnis*, a type of flowering vine with petals like human skin, and the *Dentata Lilies*, whose delicate blossoms concealed rows of sharp teeth, thrived under Dr. Thorneâ€™s expert, albeit ethically questionable, care. Sir Kaelan Reed, a decorated veteran of the Outer Rim conflicts, was appointed head of the Garden's security, his stoic demeanor a necessary counterpoint to the intoxicating, yet deadly, allure of the flora. Rumors abounded amongst the city's elite, whispered in the gilded halls of the Vance Estate, of "accidents" within the Garden's lush confines, of guests who entered but never truly left, their forms perhaps absorbed into the very fabric of Lady Elara's opulent and terrifying creation.
