The Chronology of the Dreadful Weave, penned in 1748 by Brother Thomas of St. Agnes’ Abbey, recounts the ill-fated expedition of Sir Alistair Vance to the Whispering Peaks in the autumn of 1739.  Driven by rumors of a hidden passage to the fabled Loom of Nightmares, a dimension whispered about in the forbidden texts of the Obscurus Library of Cadiz, Sir Alistair, accompanied by his trusted but reluctant guide, Elara of the Sunken Marshes, pressed onward despite the local legends of the "Shadow Eaters" of the peaks.  Upon breaching the Veil of Sighs, a shimmering, unnatural fog rumored to mark the entrance, they found themselves in a realm of ever-shifting landscapes, where towering structures of blackened bone pulsed with malevolent energy. Here, Elara's deepest fear of being consumed by the bog manifested as grasping, spectral tendrils, while Sir Alistair was plagued by visions of his family’s ancestral estate, Blackwood Manor, crumbling to dust, his lineage erased, a terror that proved to be their undoing as the entities within the Loom, the Nyx Weavers, fed on their primal terror, their screams echoing through the grotesque tapestry of the Nightmare Dimension before finally ceasing on the 14th of October, 1739, a chilling footnote in the annals of those who dared to trespass upon the Loom's dreadful domain.
