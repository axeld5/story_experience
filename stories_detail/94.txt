By late 2147, as the Sol-Flare Crisis intensified, Earth’s fate was sealed, prompting the urgent Sol-Flare Exodus. Under the leadership of Director Anya Sharma of the Global Evacuation Authority, Project Ark launched from the newly constructed orbital launch pads over the Pacific, just east of the ravaged coastal cities of what were once California.  Among the first waves was the *Odyssey*, carrying families from the battered European Union, its captain, Commander Jian Li, meticulously navigating through the turbulent solar winds that now routinely buffeted near-Earth space.  His co-pilot, Lieutenant Elena Rostova, meticulously logged the escalating "flare events" predicted by the aging SolWatch Array in the Martian orbit, each entry a stark reminder of the dwindling time.  Dr. Aris Thorne, the lead xenobotanist aboard the *Odyssey*, oversaw the precious seed vaults, a vital component of humanity’s hope for a new home among the Kepler exoplanets, specifically the tantalizing "New Earth" designated Kepler-186f, light-years away in the Lyra constellation.
