The Free Company of the *Wanderer*, a battered Free Trader vessel out of Port Coriolis, sang their sorrow into the void in the Terran Standard Year 2457.  Captain Elias "Sparrow" Thorne, a man whose face was etched with the lines of countless FTL jumps, hummed a low, mournful tune known as "The Ballad of the Shifting Sands" as they plotted a course through the infamous Chrono-Tides of the Kepler 186f system.  His crew, a motley assortment of spacers, xenos, and those with nowhere else to go, echoed the sentiment in their work-shanties, tales of ships lost not to pirates or engine failure, but to the capricious whims of time itself. There was Old Man Hemlock, the engineer, who swore he once saw his own gravestone flicker into existence on the engine room console during a particularly bad jump, and K'tharr, the Xylos navigator, whose species' sensitivity to temporal distortions often left him writhing in silent agony during passage through these turbulent zones.

Their objective: deliver a shipment of rare Zy'thar crystals to the orbital station orbiting Proxima Centauri in record time. The risk was immense, the potential temporal anomalies a constant threat. Histories whispered of the *Stella Maris*, a renowned exploration vessel that entered the Chrono-Tides in 2388 and emerged a mere day later, but with her crew aged by twenty years, their minds fractured and their bodies frail. Another tale, "The Lament of the Void-Bound Heart," spoke of the ill-fated cargo hauler *The Steadfast*, which vanished entirely in 2410, only to reappear briefly in the same location two decades later, a ghostly echo of its former self before fading once more into the temporal currents. These were the stories they sang, warnings woven into melodies, the dirges of those who challenged the very fabric of reality.
