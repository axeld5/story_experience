The year is 2687.  From the smog-choked docks of Port Celestial, the "Nebula Weaver," a rust-stained freighter commanded by the grizzled Captain Elias Thorne, set sail on the notoriously unstable ‘Chronos Corridor’ to the Kepler 186f colony.  Among the crew of 40 souls, including the young deckhand Maeve O’Malley and the ancient navigator Silas "Time-Lost" Blackwood, whose eyes held the weary knowledge of a hundred disjointed voyages, whispers of the "Star-Sailor's Dirge" – the haunting lament said to play on ships caught in temporal eddies – were a constant, low hum beneath the thrum of the aging FTL drive, a chilling reminder of those who had sailed the void and never truly returned.
