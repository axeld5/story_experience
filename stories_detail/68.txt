The year is 1147 Anno Domini. In the secluded scriptorium of the Monastery of Saint Cuthbert in Wessex, Brother Alaric, a chronicler of considerable renown, stumbled upon a peculiar vellum.  Its cover, bound in a leather not seen in centuries, bore the faded title: *Liber Bestiarum Oblivionem*.  This "Book of Forgotten Beasts" detailed creatures of legend – the shimmering griffin of the Sky-Pinnacles of Aeridor, the subterranean leviathan of the Sunken City of K'tharr, beings thought to be mere fables. The script within spoke not of myths, but of verifiable encounters, meticulously dated to the early Third Age, prior to the Great Silence of 783 BC, when the Council of Eldoria, comprised of Arch-Magi Elara and Lord Sorcerer Valerius, enacted the Pact of Forgetting, a powerful magical decree intended to purge the knowledge and existence of these formidable beings from the annals of time.

Alaric, driven by a scholar’s insatiable curiosity and a growing unease at the implications of this hidden history, began cross-referencing the entries with other ancient texts held within the monastery’s extensive library. He found fragmented accounts in the *Chronicles of the Northern Marches* from the reign of King Uther in 587 AD, referencing "winged terrors" unlike any known birds. Further evidence emerged from a translated Dwarven inscription discovered in the Mines of Moria during the reign of King Thror in 921 AD, describing earth-shattering roars from the deep. The Pact, it seemed, was faltering. As Alaric copied passages and added his own annotations, a chilling truth began to dawn: the beasts weren't just forgotten; they were returning. His findings, compiled into a document titled *The Resurgence*, reached the ears of Lord Regent Theodoric of Mercia in the summer of 1148 AD, who initially dismissed them as monastic fantasy.

However, the first undeniable signs of the Pact's decay manifested in the late autumn of 1149 AD, when the isolated village of Oakhaven, nestled at the foot of the Serpent’s Teeth mountains, was ravaged by creatures matching the description of the “Scaled Horror of the Peaks” found in the *Liber Bestiarum Oblivionem*. Survivors spoke of eyes that glowed with an unnatural light and scales that deflected iron blades. This harrowing event, coupled with reports of unusual seismic activity near the ruins of K'tharr in the same year, forced Lord Regent Theodoric to reconsider Alaric’s findings. The forgotten beasts of Eldoria, once relegated to the dustiest corners of history, were no longer a matter of academic curiosity; they were a terrifying reality demanding immediate action. The age of monsters, it seemed, was far from over.
