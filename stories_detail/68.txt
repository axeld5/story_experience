In the shadowed year of 1213, after the disastrous Battle of Wyrmwood, whispers began to circulate amongst the Arcanists of the Golden Citadel.  They spoke of the *Codex Eldoria*, a long-lost bestiary meticulously compiled by the renowned Sage Theron of Aethelgard during the Eldorian Age (circa 500-700 CE). For centuries, the creatures within its pages, from the ethereal Aether-Wisp of the Whispering Dunes to the subterranean earth-shaker known only as the Grumble-Tongue, were thought to be mere myth, their existence apparently expunged by the Great Abjuration of 892 CE, a pact solidified at the Convocation of Ironhelm. Yet, within the dusty archives of the University of Silverwood, a young scholar, Elara of the Sunken Isles, stumbled upon a faded, annotated copy of the Codex, bearing the mark of the disgraced Archmage Alaric, who vanished during the Unmaking of 1198. As Elara delved into its forbidden knowledge, strange occurrences began to plague the lands around the forgotten ruins of Old Norhaven, hinting that the Abjuration was failing, and the beasts of Eldoria were stirring from their enforced slumber.
