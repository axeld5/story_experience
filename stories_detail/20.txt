The year is 142 AE, the Age of Embers, and the Scoured Plains of Aethelgard lay barren, save for the morbid groves tended by the Bone Magi. Lord Valerius Thorne, a necromancer of considerable, some would say unholy, repute, surveyed his nascent Bone Orchard near the ruins of Old Oakhaven. The air was thick with the metallic tang of the consecrated soil, a blend of finely ground bone dust from the fallen of the Siege of Blackspire and the alchemical catalysts whispered of in forbidden texts. Valerius, his gaunt face etched with the focus of decades, knelt, pressing a gnarled hand into the earth. His intent was not to sow seeds of grain, but to cultivate the very marrow of life into pliable, obedient forms. His prize, a nascent Greater Guardian, was showing promising signs of articulation, its ribcage slowly, deliberately, taking shape from the earth beneath his touch.

Across the treacherous Spineback Peaks, in the flourishing Free Cities of Veridia, the Council of Elders viewed the growing power of the Bone Magi with increasing alarm. Arch-Hierophant Seraphina of Sunstone, a beacon of the Radiant Faith, spoke vehemently against the "blight of necromantic agriculture" during the Council's session in the Grand Athenaeum of Lysandra on the 3rd of Floralia, 143 AE. Tales of Valerius Thorne's burgeoning forces – legions of tireless skeletal sentinels and towering Bone Colossi – reached their ears through nervous merchant caravans traversing the Bloodfang Pass. While the Bone Magi claimed their creations were merely guardians, the whispers of the reanimated dead walking the plains were a chilling counterpoint to their assertions of peaceful cultivation. The stage was set for a conflict, not of swords and shields, but of life and undeath, for dominance over the very essence of being.
