The annals of the Thirteenth Age, specifically the reign of the Bone Queen, reveal the intricate genesis of the Bone Orchard Cycle, a period defined by the macabre artistry of the necromancers of the Cryptic Gardens.  It was in the bleak year of 1287 AS (After Sorcery) in the decaying city of Ossa Magna, under the watchful eye of High Necromancer Valerius, that the first successful harvests of enchanted soil yielded the towering, silent guardians that would later be known as the Ossian Sentinels.  The Lady Isolde, a reclusive yet formidable practitioner, refined these techniques in her hidden stronghold of Marrowfield Keep during the winter of 1291 AS, developing the intricate binding rituals that gave the skeletal constructs their unwavering loyalty, a loyalty that would be tested repeatedly throughout the subsequent Bone Wars against the living kingdoms.
