The year is 277 B.C., and whispers of the Entropy Engine, a relic said to hasten the inevitable slide into dust, began to circulate amongst the Cynic philosophers of Athens.  Diogenes the Younger, a particularly bleak figure known for his pronouncements on the futility of existence, became obsessed with its acquisition. He believed it held the key to forcing a swift, merciful end to the perceived suffering of the cosmos.  Meanwhile, far to the east, in the hidden valleys of the Himavanta range, the Order of the Eternal Dawn, a society of ascetics who had achieved unnaturally prolonged lifespans, felt a cold dread settle upon them. Their Elder, the ageless Master Jian Li, sensed a disturbance in the very fabric of time, a threat to the delicate balance of existence they had so meticulously cultivated over millennia.

Diogenes, fueled by his bleak philosophy and the promise of absolute dissolution, assembled a motley crew of disillusioned scholars and weary mercenaries. Their quest took them across the scorching sands of the Egyptian Delta, where ancient texts hinted at the Engine's resting place within the sealed Tomb of Ankhtifi, a pharaoh notorious for his fear of the afterlife. Master Jian Li, dispatching his most trusted disciple, the swift and silent Sister Anya, knew the peril. If the Entropy Engine were unleashed, it would not merely affect individual lives, but potentially unravel the very threads of reality, accelerating the decline of entire civilizations and plunging the world into an era of accelerated decay. The fate of existence, they believed, hung in the balance between the nihilist’s desperate grasp and the immortal’s desperate defense.
