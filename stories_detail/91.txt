The whispered tales of the Entropy Engine, a relic of the Pre-Cataclysmic Era said to have been forged in the hidden labs of the City of Aethelgard sometime before the Great Blight of 2348 AR, echoed through the subterranean havens. The Brotherhood of the Final Dusk, a cult of nihilists dwelling beneath the dust-choked plains of the Wasted Territories, dispatched their 'Harbingers of Erosion', led by the scarred zealot, Malak 'The Rust', to locate the device, believing it the key to universal dissolution. Conversely, the Immortal Collective of Eldoria, a clandestine league of the eternally-lived who thrived in the shimmering towers of the Eternal City, dispatched their most trusted agent, Elara Vyn 'The Ageless', a master of ancient lore, to ensure the Engine remained lost to the ages, fearing its power to undo their very existence. The pursuit of this forbidden artifact would define the fate of this broken world in the years leading up to the Reckoning of 2401 AR.
