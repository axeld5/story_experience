The whispers began in the shadowed alleys of Old Aethelburg, not of plague or famine, but of something far more insidious. They spoke of the Entropy Engine, a device of unnatural power, rumored to unravel the very fabric of time and existence, accelerating decay and bringing swift, final oblivion. For millennia, the Immortals, those who had defied the natural order through arcane means or accidental discovery, had lived in comfortable defiance of mortality. Now, a chill not felt since the Great Sundering crept into their ageless bones.

The Engine was not a new invention. Legends spoke of its creation in the forgotten age of the Technomancers, during the reign of King Veridian the Foolish, circa 783 BCE. Its creator, the reclusive and brilliant Alistair Thorne, a man consumed by a morbid fascination with entropy, had allegedly destroyed his creation before it could unleash chaos upon the world. But the whispers persisted, claiming a hidden vault, a forgotten blueprint, or perhaps, the Engine itself, lay dormant somewhere in the world, awaiting a catalyst.

This catalyst arrived in the form of Kaelen Blackwood, a man whose eyes held the cold, detached glint of absolute nihilism. Born in the desolate wastes of the Glimmering Sands in 1875 CE, Kaelen had witnessed such profound suffering and meaninglessness that he had come to believe existence itself was a mistake. He gathered around him a cult of like-minded individuals, the “Devotees of the Void,” who saw the Entropy Engine not as a weapon of destruction, but as the ultimate release from the burdensome cycle of life.

Their first known act of aggression occurred in 1905 CE, a brazen raid on the Archives of Eldoria, a repository of forbidden knowledge located high in the Obsidian Peaks. The Immortals, typically detached observers of mortal affairs, were stirred to action. Among them was Lady Isolde Vance, an ancient being whose existence stretched back to the Roman Empire, and Lord Marius Thorne, a direct descendant of Alistair Thorne himself, who bore the heavy burden of his ancestor’s creation.

Lady Isolde, with her vast network of spies and informants, discovered that the Devotees were searching for fragmented schematics of the Engine. Her agents intercepted a shipment in the bustling port of Port Azure in 1908 CE, containing cryptic diagrams and notes in Alistair Thorne's hand. It became clear that the Engine, or at least the knowledge of its construction, was real.

Lord Marius, a scholar and historian by nature, felt a personal responsibility to atone for his ancestor’s folly. He delved into dusty tomes and forgotten family histories, searching for any clue to the Engine's whereabouts or a means to counteract its effects. His research led him to believe that the Engine required a specific power source, something connected to the fundamental forces of the universe, a detail missing from the intercepted schematics.

Meanwhile, Kaelen Blackwood, driven by an almost religious fervor, continued his relentless pursuit. His Devotees, though fewer in number, were fanatical in their devotion. They committed acts of sabotage and terror across the known world, targeting institutions and individuals associated with the Immortals, sowing fear and chaos. The attack on the Celestial Observatory in Veridian City in 1912 CE, while failing to yield the power source Kaelen sought, sent shockwaves through the Immortal community.

The race was on. Lady Isolde, with her practical cunning, focused on tracking Kaelen’s movements and disrupting his plans. Lord Marius, with his scholarly knowledge, sought to understand the Engine’s true nature and find a way to neutralize it. Their paths, though separate, were intertwined by the shared threat. The years bled into one another, the pursuit stretching across continents and oceans, marked by skirmishes and near misses.

In 1925 CE, a breakthrough. Lord Marius, poring over a centuries-old family diary, discovered a hidden message indicating the Entropy Engine was not destroyed, but sealed away in a secret location: the Crypt of Ages, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to lie beneath the ruins of ancient Ebonhold. Simultaneously, Lady Isolde's agents confirmed Kaelen Blackwood was heading towards the same location, his Devotees mobilizing for a final push.

The confrontation was inevitable. The air crackled with tension as Lady Isolde and her Immortal allies, including the formidable warrior Kaelen of the Crimson Blade (no relation to Blackwood) and the enigmatic sorceress Elara, faced Kaelen Blackwood and his cult within the decaying grandeur of the Crypt of Ages. The scent of dust and decay hung heavy, fitting for a place that might soon house the ultimate instrument of oblivion.
