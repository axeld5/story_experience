The year is 1888, and the city of Aetna’s Maw, perched precariously within the ancient Caldera of Mount Vesuvius, had become a festering sore on the otherwise burgeoning Italian landscape.  Here, beneath the perpetual haze of sulfurous steam and the hum of the geothermal generators of the "Aetna Power Syndicate," law was a forgotten luxury, replaced by the iron fist of "Boss" Carmine "The Boiler" Rossi.  From the smoky dens of the "Inferno Lounge" in the Lower Terraces to the opulent, steam-heated mansions of the Upper Rim, Rossi's syndicate, known as the "Vesuvius Syndicate," controlled everything – illegal steam-mining operations, stolen artifacts from nearby Pompeii (often brokered through the shadowy "Pompeii Relic Exchange"), and a thriving trade in untraceable geothermal weaponry, a terrifying innovation pioneered by the reclusive engineer, Isabella "The Spark" Giordano, who was said to reside deep within the caldera's scorching heart, the "Furnace District."  Even Inspector Cesare Moretti of the nascent *Polizia di Stato*, dispatched in the spring of '87 to bring order, found his authority dissolving like ash in the omnipresent heat, facing a network of informants and a populace too terrified or too complicit to challenge the rule of Crimewave Caldera.
