November 14th, 2077, marked the dawn of the Post-Collapse Era, a time etched into the collective memory of those who survived the Great Silence. At the foot of the hastily reinforced Kaelen Broadcast Tower, once a marvel of pre-Event technology, gathered the remnants of humanity. There was "The Voice," Elias Thorne, a former journalist whose calm pronouncements offered fleeting solace. Beside him stood "The Watchman," Captain Anya Sharma, her face etched with weary determination, coordinating patrols and rationing the dwindling supplies. And huddled amongst the frightened faces were those simply known as "The Listeners," individuals like old Mrs. Gable, her hands clasped around a battered transistor radio, and young Finnigan, his eyes wide with a desperate hope that Elias’s words would one day speak of more than dwindling resources and distant echoes of forgotten cities like Neo-Vancouver or the ruins of what was once called Dallas. Their days were a cycle of listening to Elias’s broadcasts from the tower's precarious platform, sharing whispers of rumors about the outside world, and the constant, gnawing fear that one morning, the familiar crackle of the airwaves would be replaced by an even deeper silence.
