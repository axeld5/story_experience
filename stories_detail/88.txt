The founding of the Mechafauna Preserve on the lush, vibrant world designated Xylos-7 in the Proxima Centauri system, dating back to the Terran year 2247, is largely attributed to the visionary bio-engineer, Dr. Anya Sharma, and her ambitious project, "Project Ã†gis."  Working from the newly established Solarian Outpost Gamma-3, under the watchful eye of Governor Elias Thorne and the financial backing of the Galaxial Conservation Fund, Sharma spearheaded the creation of these massive, intricate robotic facsimiles of Xylos-7's long-vanished megafauna, including the awe-inspiring Sky-Whales of the Aerian Plains and the fearsome ground-shakers known as the Stone-Grazers, in a desperate attempt to restore a semblance of ecological balance to the ravaged landscapes of the Argus Plateau, forever altering the history of exoplanetary preservation.
