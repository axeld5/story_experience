The year was 1488, and a creeping dread began to settle over the duchy of Aquitaine. whispers of a new illness, a "Dream Rot," circulated like wildfire through the market squares of Bordeaux and the scattered villages clinging to the Dordogne. At first, they were dismissed as peasant superstition, tales of waking nightmares and fading phantoms. But soon, the physical evidence became undeniable.

Margot, the baker’s wife in the small hamlet of Sainte-Croix-du-Mont, was the first in her village to succumb. Her husband, Jean-Luc, found strange, shimmering shapes clinging to the walls of their cottage one morning. They pulsed with an unnatural light, shifting and reforming like woven mist. He recognized them with a sickening certainty; they were the visions Margot had spoken of in her fevered sleep, fragments of her deepest fears and forgotten desires, now made tragically real.

Across the river, in the fortified town of Libourne, Master Apothecary Étienne Dubois, a man of science and reason, initially scoffed at the reports. He attributed the strange phenomena to mass hysteria, a collective delusion born of poverty and hardship. But then, his own apprentice, young Théo, began to manifest the signs. A grotesque, scaled creature, straight from Théo’s nightmares of the river monsters, began to coagulate in the corner of the workshop, its form solidifying with every shuddering breath the boy took.

As the spring turned to summer, the Dream Rot spread relentlessly. In the vineyards of Saint-Émilion, ethereal grapevines, shimmering with a sickly, phosphorescent glow, would sprout from the earth overnight, only to wither and crumble into dust by midday. In the bustling port of La Rochelle, phantom ships, their spectral sails billowing in an unfelt wind, would appear on the horizon, a chilling echo of sailors' longing or their fear of the endless ocean.

Duke Henri of Aquitaine, initially isolated in his opulent chateau near Angoulême, was forced to confront the reality of the plague when similar manifestations began to appear in his own courtyard. A magnificent, but ultimately fragile, dream-stag, born of his hunting fantasies, would materialize only to dissolve into shimmering motes before his eyes. Fear, sharp and primal, gripped the nobility.

Brother Thomas, a humble monk at the Abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Fronsac, began to meticulously record the occurrences. His journal, later known as the ‘Chronicle of the Waking Dreams,’ provided invaluable insight into the progression of the disease. He noted the varied forms the manifestations took – from fleeting glimpses of lost loved ones to terrifying apparitions of inner demons. He also observed that the dreams of the young were often vibrant and colourful, while those of the elderly tended to be muted and sorrowful, mirroring the fading light of their lives.

Desperate measures were taken. Priests performed exorcisms, their holy water hissing against the dream-manifestations with little effect. Physicians brewed potent concoctions, but the illness defied conventional remedies. Entire villages were quarantined, their inhabitants left to confront their waking dreams in isolation, the air thick with the scent of decay and the silent screams of their fading hopes.

It was a peasant woman named Elodie, living in the isolated hamlet of Belvès, who stumbled upon a crude, but surprisingly effective, method of containment. She discovered that surrounding a Dream Rot victim with simple, unyielding stone or clay seemed to prevent the manifestations from spreading beyond a certain point. The dreams, confined, would slowly lose their intensity, eventually fading into nothingness, taking the victim with them, a quiet, tragic end.

Duke Henri, hearing of Elodie’s discovery, ordered the construction of “dream-prisons” – small, stone structures built around the afflicted. It was a grim solution, a tomb for the living, but it slowed the relentless spread of the plague. The year 1489 saw the construction of these somber buildings throughout Aquitaine, standing as silent testaments to the power of the mind and the fragility of reality.

The Dream Rot Plague did not vanish overnight. It lingered for years, a dark cloud over Aquitaine, leaving behind a landscape scarred by the remnants of materialized dreams and the memory of those who were lost to their own minds. The Chronicle of the Waking Dreams remains a chilling reminder of that time, a testament to the year the lines between sleep and waking blurred, and dreams became a deadly force.
