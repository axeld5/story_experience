The year 1348, during the reign of King Edward III, saw the unsettling whispers of the Dream Rot Plague reach the bustling port city of Bristol.  Master Apothecary Alistair Finch, a man of science and not superstition, initially dismissed the reports as peasant folklore.  However, the appearance of decaying, ethereal lilies emanating from the sleeping form of Eleanor Vance, the merchant's wife, shattered his skepticism.  In the stifling alleys of St. Nicholas Market, the afflicted, like poor Thomas Baker, were found muttering incoherently, their nightmares of gnawing rats and crumbling stones manifesting as fleeting, putrid shadows around them.  It was Bishop Geoffrey of Worcester who, in a desperate bid for understanding, commissioned Brother Silas, a scribe from the Abbey of St. Augustine, to meticulously document these bizarre phenomena, hoping to find a pattern in the waking visions of their tormented flock before the rot consumed them entirely.
