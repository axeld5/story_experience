The year of our Lord 1578 began inauspiciously in the bustling port of Port Faire. It was there that the first unsettling rumors began to circulate, whispered by weary sailors arriving from the east. They spoke of a peculiar malady striking down men in the Free Cities, not with fever or pox, but with visions made real. Initial reports from the physician, Master Alaric, were met with skepticism by the Council of Nine. They were too preoccupied with the impending trade negotiations with the Principality of Eldoria to heed what they dismissed as sailor’s superstitions. Yet, the unsettling phenomenon began to appear closer to home. In the humble dwelling of the tailor, Thomas Croft, his nightmares of being consumed by a swarm of iridescent beetles began to solidify in his waking world, a shimmering, chittering mass that filled his small room before dissolving into a putrid dust. The council’s indifference quickly turned to alarm as more cases emerged across the city in the following weeks of Spring.

By the Summer of 1578, the "Dream Rot Plague," as it became morbidly known, had spread beyond Port Faire's walls, following the trade routes north towards the capital city of Kingsport. The victims, from the lowliest dockhand to the esteemed scholar Professor Anya Petrova, were afflicted by their dreams taking tangible form, fleeting and fragile at first, then growing more substantial and horrifying before their inevitable decay. These decaying manifestations left behind a noxious residue, sickening those who came into contact with it. The efforts of Sister Agnes at the Sanctuary of the Blessed Mother to contain the disease through prayer and herbal remedies proved futile against the encroaching tide of materialized anxieties. Fear gripped the land, and as the year drew to a close, the once vibrant kingdom of Eldoria found itself grappling with a foe born not of flesh and blood, but of the very substance of nightmares. The court physician, Lord Evander, a man of science, frantically searched for a cure, pouring over ancient texts in the Grand Library of Kingsport, seeking answers in the annals of history, hoping to find a precedent for such a bizarre and terrifying affliction.
