The whispers began in the courts of Eldoria around 412 AE (After Empire), hushed tales of shadows that danced in the reflective surfaces of ornate mirrors.  These were no ordinary reflections, but portals, they said, traversed by individuals of unnerving grace and chilling efficiency. They called them the Mirror Walkers, a moniker that instilled fear in even the most hardened guards of King Theron IX.

Our tale begins with Elara of the Sunken City, a woman whose lineage was as old as the coastal tides. Elara was no warrior, but a scholar of forgotten lore, her days spent deciphering ancient scripts within the dusty libraries of Veridian. Yet, her keen intellect and uncanny ability to discern truth from deception drew the attention of the clandestine organization known as the Obsidian Hand, a shadowy cabal rumored to be the architects of the Mirror Walkers.

It was in the spring of 415 AE, during a diplomatic mission to the bustling port city of Port Nyanzaru, that Elara first encountered the chilling reality of their craft. Ambassador Jaron, a man known for his unwavering loyalty to Eldoria, was found dead in his chambers, his face contorted in a rictus of surprise, a small shard of polished obsidian clutched in his lifeless hand. The only clue was the faint shimmer in the ornate dressing mirror, a ripple that vanished moments after it appeared.

Master Kael, a seasoned veteran of the Royal Guard and a man of few words but sharp instincts, was tasked with the investigation. He had heard the rumors, dismissed them as fanciful tales for frightened children. But the scene in Ambassador Jaron’s chambers defied all conventional explanations. He noticed the peculiar coolness emanating from the mirror, a subtle difference in temperature that lingered long after.

Simultaneously, across the treacherous peaks of the Dragon’s Tooth Mountains, in the heavily guarded fortress of Aethelgard, Lord Valerius, a powerful and ambitious noble suspected of treason, received a visitor. This visitor did not enter through the gate, nor the secret tunnel known only to a select few. He materialized, seemingly from the silvered surface of a modest hand mirror Lord Valerius kept on his desk – a man cloaked in shadow, his face a blur of shifting light.

This was Silas, a notorious Mirror Walker known for his brutal efficiency. His mission was clear: deliver a message that would solidify Lord Valerius’s allegiance to the Obsidian Hand and ensure the disruption of Eldoria’s trade routes. The message, whispered with a voice like scraping stones, contained intelligence only a Mirror Walker could acquire – details of Eldoria’s military movements gathered from observations made within the very walls of King Theron’s war room.

Back in Veridian, Elara, pouring over ancient texts on dimensional travel, stumbled upon a passage describing “reflective thresholds” and “silvered gates.” The fragmented verses spoke of individuals who could “step between worlds” using specially crafted mirrors. The descriptions, though cryptic, sent a shiver of recognition down her spine, connecting the dots between Ambassador Jaron's death and the growing fear of the Mirror Walkers.

In the summer of 416 AE, Kael, following a trail of subtle anomalies – faint distortions in reflective surfaces and reports of fleeting figures in windows – tracked a suspected Mirror Walker to the labyrinthine alleys of the Thieves' Quarter in Blackwater Bay. He found not a single assassin, but a network of smaller mirrors, strategically placed to create a series of interconnected portals. It was a transit hub for these shadow agents.

It was here, in a dimly lit tavern called the "Broken Reflection," that Kael finally confronted a Mirror Walker, a lithe figure named Lyra, known for her ability to blend into any crowd. Their battle was a disorienting dance of disappearing and reappearing forms, Lyra using the reflective surfaces of the tavern to her advantage, stepping in and out of existence with unnerving speed.

Though Lyra escaped through a large, cracked mirror behind the bar, Kael managed to retrieve a small, intricately carved piece of obsidian from the scene, identical to the one found in Ambassador Jaron’s hand. He now had tangible proof. The Mirror Walkers were real, their capabilities terrifying, and their reach far greater than anyone had imagined. The age of the Mirror Walkers had truly begun, casting a long and unsettling shadow over the lands of Eldoria and beyond.
