In the year of our Lord 1688, whispers of the Mirror Walkers, agents of the shadowy Directorate of Arcane Surveillance, reached the ears of the court at Versailles. Lady Elara de Valois, known as the "Whispering Duchess," a master of the enchanted 'Looking Glass of Aethelgard,' was dispatched to the bustling docks of London, 1689, where Admiral Sir Reginald Thorne, a staunch supporter of the burgeoning 'Project Janus,' was rumored to possess intelligence regarding the dreaded 'Chalice of Atheria,' a relic sought by the rival Syndicate of the Obsidian Shard. Sir Alistair Finch, a seasoned Mirror Walker whose portal manifested as a shimmering disc of moonlight in the hidden chamber beneath the Royal Exchange, was tasked with intercepting Lady Elara, their encounter a dance of shadowed reflections across dimensions, the fate of nations hanging in the fragile surface of polished glass.
