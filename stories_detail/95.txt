In the waning years of the Reign of Empress Anya the Radiant, circa 1487 AE (After Enlightenment), a shadow fell upon the Grand Duchy of Eldoria. This shadow bore the mark of the "Mirror Walkers," a clandestine society of assassins and spies who manipulated enchanted looking-glasses to traverse impossible distances in an instant. Lord Regent Valerius the Prudent, charged with the security of the realm after the Empress's sudden illness, grew increasingly concerned by the swift, silent deaths of key advisors and the unnerving disappearance of sensitive state documents. Whispers spoke of figures appearing in the reflective surfaces of gilded mirrors within locked chambers, delivering a fatal blow or snatching crucial scrolls before vanishing back into the polished glass. The most notorious of these agents was known only as "The Shard," a ruthless individual whose signature was a single, impossibly sharp sliver of obsidian left at the scene of their kills.

The first documented instance of a Mirror Walkerâ€™s intervention occurred on the night of the Spring Equinox, 1488 AE, within the heavily guarded Red Citadel of Valoria. Baroness Lysandra of Silverwood, a staunch opponent of certain political factions, was found dead in her private study, a look of terror frozen on her face, reflected in the large, ornate mirror that dominated one wall. Subsequent investigations yielded no signs of forced entry, only the lingering scent of ozone and a faint shimmer in the air near the mirror's surface. Commander Joric of the Imperial Guard, a seasoned veteran of the Border Skirmishes, was tasked with uncovering this elusive threat. He pored over ancient texts and interrogated alchemists rumored to dabble in forbidden arts, seeking any knowledge of such unnatural transportation.

Through relentless investigation, Commander Joric learned of the legendary "Gateway Mirrors," artifacts imbued with potent dimensional energies by forgotten mages during the Age of Sundering. It was believed the Mirror Walkers had either rediscovered or replicated this lost art. His search led him to the shadowed alleys of Port Calidor, a haven for illicit trade and forgotten lore. There, in the dusty archives of the Arcane Collegium, he unearthed fragmented journals detailing the training of Mirror Walkers within the hidden Monastery of the Fractured Light, nestled deep within the treacherous Jagged Peaks. The journals spoke of rigorous discipline, of mastering the "Reflective Step," and of the unwavering loyalty demanded by their shadowy benefactors, whose identities remained a chilling mystery.
