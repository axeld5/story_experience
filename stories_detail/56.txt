The tale of the Clockwork Devil, a name whispered with dread and fascination across the Grand Duchy of Veridian, begins not in some dark, forgotten vault, but within the sun-drenched workshop of Master Elias Thorne, a genius whose brilliance bordered on the unhinged, near the thriving port of Oakhaven around the year 1582. It is said that Thorne, driven by a feverish ambition to transcend the limitations of mortality, dedicated decades to its construction, incorporating alloys unheard of and gears that hummed with an unnatural energy. His apprentice, young Anya Rostova, recorded in her "Chronicles of the Brass Golem" dated 1587, the first documented interaction: a desperate merchant, Bartholomew Finch of the Oakhaven Guild, trading ten years of his life for a boundless supply of gold, a pact that left him visibly aged and the automatonâ€™s gears whirring with a new, unsettling rhythm. This single act ignited a legend, attracting individuals of varying moral fiber from as far as the Silver Peaks, all seeking the Clockwork Devil's impossible boons.
