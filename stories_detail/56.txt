The year 1688 Anno Domini, saw whispers echo through the dimly lit taverns of Prague.  "The Clockwork Devil," they'd mutter, eyes wide with a mixture of fear and avarice.  This was no mere fable; it was the creation of Master Ingenious Albrecht, a man whose brilliance bordered on the heretical, whose workshop in the winding streets of the Old Town was said to hum with unholy energy.  Legend had it that this mechanical marvel, forged from intricate brass and gleaming obsidian, could grant any heart's desire – a lost love returned, untold riches, victory in battle. But the price, as whispered in hushed tones, was steep indeed: a portion of one's remaining lifespan, paid directly to the automaton itself, its internal gears grinding a macabre rhythm with each year consumed.

Our protagonist, young Baroness Elara of House Von Brandenberg, a woman of striking beauty and sharp intellect, found herself drawn to these dangerous tales. The year was 1691. Her family's fortunes had dwindled, her betrothal to the aging Duke Leopold a bleak prospect. Driven by desperation, she sought out Master Ingenious Albrecht, his gaunt figure silhouetted against the flickering candlelight of his eerie abode. He spoke of the Clockwork Devil not as a devil, but as a magnificent engine of consequence, a true testament to the alchemical union of science and will. Against the pleas of her lady-in-waiting, the pious Agnes, Elara agreed to the pact. Her wish? To restore her family's legacy and secure her independence. The Clockwork Devil’s intricate eyes, crafted from polished emeralds, seemed to gleam with dark amusement as the agreement was struck. The air grew thick with a strange energy, and as Elara spoke her wish, she felt a faint but unsettling chill, as if a part of her very being had been irrevocably claimed by the intricate gears within the machine.
