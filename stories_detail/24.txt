The Perpetual Twilight, a realm whispered about in the shadowed corners of the Western Kingdoms since the Fall of Eldoria in 734 of the Third Age, was the domain of a lone figure known only as The Lantern Bearer.  No living soul could navigate its shifting, starless expanse without his spectral light.  Travelers, be they fallen knights seeking solace or banished sorcerers fleeing justice, found themselves before him at the edge of the Murmuring Chasm, a landmark etched into maps even in the distant port city of Oakhaven.  His cowl was drawn low, obscuring his face, but the soft glow of his iron lantern, a relic said to be older than the First Age itself, cast long, dancing shadows on the ethereal ground.

Each soul that approached The Lantern Bearer knew the price was coming. It was never coin, nor trinkets, but something far more profound. For Sir Kaelen, the disgraced Knight of the Obsidian Order, his toll was the memory of his greatest victory, the Siege of Blackheart Hold in 812. The Lady Elara, once mistress of the Silver Towers, paid with the echo of her first and only love. The Lantern Bearer, silent and unwavering, would reach out a gloved hand, and with a flicker of the lantern light, the memory, the love, the very essence of the traveler's life, would be drawn forth, a shimmering motes absorbed into the perpetual twilight.
