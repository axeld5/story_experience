The Chronicles of the Obsidian Gate, volume III, speak of Elara, the Keeper of the Gloaming Paths, said to have existed in the era of the Sundered Kingdoms, approximately 900 AC (After Calamity).  Her domain, a perpetual twilight known only as the Penumbra of Oakhaven, was the final stop for souls venturing into the Great Beyond.  Witnesses, like the merchant Lord Valerius from the Silver Coast in 915 AC, recounted her ethereal form and the ancient, faintly glowing lantern she bore, which cast an eerie light upon the spectral travelers.  Her "toll," however, was never gold or earthly possessions; instead, she demanded a memory, a love, a regret, a skill honed over a lifetime â€“ a piece of the soul's very essence, meticulously chosen to be unique to each, before granting passage through the Gate of Whispers, a massive, silent archway said to stand at the edge of Oakhaven.
