The year was 1347 of the Age of Refinement, and in the shadowed workshop hidden beneath the bustling city of Veridian, young Elara, daughter of the esteemed merchant Lord Atherton, toiled under the gaze of Master Kael, known whispered throughout the hidden guilds as the Soulsmith.  Elara, a prodigious talent with molten metal and mystic runes, had traded silks and ledgers for the acrid scent of brimstone and the chilling touch of captured souls.  Master Kael, a gaunt figure whose eyes held the weary knowledge of centuries, taught her the terrifying dance between creation and damnation.  He showed her how to draw forth the ephemeral essence of a departed spirit – a warrior's courage, a scholar's wit, a lover's fierce devotion – and bind it, protesting and shimmering, into the core of cold steel or sturdy plate.  Their creations were weapons of unparalleled power, armor that seemed to shrug off blows as if they were mere trifles, sought after by the desperate, the ambitious, and the ethically bankrupt alike.  From the gleaming Shield of the Steadfast Heart, commissioned by the beleaguered Duke Rowan of the Grey Marches in 1348, to the whispering Dagger of Memories, forged in the suffocating heat of a summer’s night in 1349, each piece carried the weight of a stolen life and the growing shadow of Elara's own immortal fate.

The whispers of their trade, though carefully guarded, began to leak like venom through the cracks of the city. The Arcane Censors, the vigilant guardians of the College of Mages in the city of Aethelgard, felt the unnatural ripples in the fabric of reality emanating from Veridian. Grand Inquisitor Thorne, a man whose piety was as sharp as his judgment, began to make discreet inquiries. Elara, now known amongst the few who understood her craft as the Shadow Forger, felt the pressure building. Each soul she bound felt heavier than the last, each creation a step closer to the inevitable reckoning. Master Kael, his skin growing paler, his steps slower, warned her of the cost – not just the earthly price, but the spiritual debt that would one day be collected by the unforgiving entities who governed the ethereal planes. Their most ambitious project, the creation of the Soul-Bound Cuirass for the enigmatic warlord, General Borin, in the spring of 1350, pushed them to the very edge of what was permissible, drawing the attention of forces far older and more terrible than the Censors of Aethelgard.
