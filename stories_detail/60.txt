In the shadowed workshops of the Black Iron City, around the year 1372 AE (After the Era of Awakening), young Kaelan, a promising apprentice under the reclusive Master Eldrin, found himself increasingly drawn to the whispers surrounding the forbidden art of Soulsmithing. His days began with the clang of hammer on mundane steel in the Forging District, a stark contrast to the clandestine nights spent in Master Eldrin's hidden chambers beneath the Eldoria Library Annex. Here, surrounded by ancient texts like the 'Codex of Anima' and forbidden relics like the 'Shard of the Damned,' Kaelan learned not just how to shape metal, but how to bind the very essence of fallen warriors and restless spirits into formidable weapons and protective armaments, each piece a perilous dance with potential damnation.
