In the 73rd year of the Age of Stellara, as recorded in the archives of the Grand Observatory of Eldoria, the Celestial Conclave of Veridian convened. Arch-Mage Lysandra, titled the "Whisperer of Andromeda," a descendant of the ancient Stargazers of Oriel, unveiled her revolutionary interpretation of the Cygnus Rune Cluster, a breakthrough that promised unprecedented control over atmospheric currents. This challenged the established order, primarily Lord Castor, the "Guardian of Ursa Major," who controlled the vital trade winds flowing through the treacherous Serpent's Coil pass near the city of Aethelgard. The ensuing "War of the Whispering Winds," though brief, saw celestial duels above the Crystal Peaks of Kyros, culminating in Lysandra's mastery over the skies and the reshaping of the geopolitical landscape, ushering in the Lysandran Accord of 75 AE.
