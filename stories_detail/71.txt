The "Ares Initiative," launched from Earth in the year 2147, under the leadership of Director Anya Sharma and lead xenobiologist Dr. Kenji Tanaka, represented humanity's boldest stride towards interplanetary colonization.  Their objective: transform the arid Martian surface at Valles Marineris into a habitable zone.  The deployment of the "Genesis Seed" – a complex bio-engineering package containing specially cultivated extremophiles and a genetically modified oxygen-producing flora strain, *Terraformica Primus* – commenced on June 18th, 2148.  Initial reports from the "Odyssey Base," a pressurized habitat built near the landing zone, were optimistic, detailing rapid atmospheric changes and burgeoning microbial life.  However, by early 2149, anomalies began to appear: *Terraformica Primus*, exposed to unexpected radiation levels and the unique Martian soil composition, underwent rapid, unpredictable mutations, its growth accelerating uncontrollably and its output shifting from oxygen to toxic methane, while some early colonists, including Engineer Jian Li and Geologist Eva Rostova, began exhibiting disturbing physiological alterations, the first signs of the ecological horrors that would leave "Terraform Zero" a cautionary tale whispered across the solar system.
