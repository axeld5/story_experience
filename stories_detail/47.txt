In the Year of Our Lord 1347, as the Black Death ravaged the lands beyond the whispering pines of Blackwood Forest, the village of Oakhaven, nestled on its edge, found itself facing not pestilence, but a different kind of terror. Raids by the Bloodfang Bandits, led by the infamous "Scarred Hand" Theron, had left their stores bare and their hearts heavy. Driven to the brink by starvation and fear, Elder Elara, a woman of weathered wisdom and the last of the village elders following the untimely demise of Elder Mathis, gathered the remaining villagers near the ancient Heartwood Oak on the eve of the Autumnal Equinox. There, under a sky painted with the ominous hues of a setting sun, they made a desperate pact with the entity said to dwell deep within Blackwood â€“ the Thorn Witch. Unbeknownst to the villagers, the Witch, whose name whispered in fear was Mortis Spinarum, demanded a price far sharper than any bandit's blade.
