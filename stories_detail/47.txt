The harsh winter of 1347 had settled over the small village of Oakhaven like a shroud. Raids from the bandit chief, "Blackheart" Rolf, were becoming bolder, his men burning farmsteads and stealing what little grain remained. Elder Maeve, her face a roadmap of worry lines, gathered the villagers in the draughty Meeting Hall on the eve of the Vernal Equinox. Desperation hung heavy in the air. It was then that young Finnian, the village hunter, recounted tales of the ancient entity said to dwell in the Blackwood, a being whispered about in hushed tones and known only as the Thorn Witch. A pact, he suggested, might offer them a shield against Blackheart's cruelty.

Against the fervent warnings of Brother Thomas, a newly arrived priest from the Abbey of St. Jude in the neighboring territory of Westmarch, a delegation was chosen. Led by Finnian and the pragmatic blacksmith, Gawain, they ventured into the Blackwood under the waxing moon of April 1348. Deep within the shadowed heart of the ancient forest, amongst trees twisted and gnarled like skeletal fingers, they found her. The Thorn Witch, a figure cloaked in woven thorns and smelling of damp earth and bitter herbs, listened with unnerving stillness to their pleas for protection. The pact was simple, a promise of safe passage for Oakhaven, a guarantee against Blackheart and his ilk. The price, whispered in a voice like rustling leaves, was unspoken, a chilling understanding that settled in their bones.

Upon their return to Oakhaven on the 2nd of May, a strange calm descended. Blackheart's raids ceased abruptly. His scouts, when encountered on the fringes of the Blackwood, were found impaled on impossibly sharp thorns that seemed to sprout from the very ground. The village was safe, but the air grew thick with a cloying, floral scent. The roses in Elder Maeve's garden, once delicate, now grew with unnatural speed, their thorns like wicked little daggers. A creeping unease began to replace the fear of bandits, a silent question hanging in the minds of the villagers of Oakhaven: what, exactly, was the thorny price they had truly paid?
