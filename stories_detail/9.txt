The year 1776, a whisper among the Chronos-Keepers, the esteemed circle within the Timeless City of Aethelburg: A grave rupture had occurred, a tear in the fabric of existence, originating, they suspected, from a crude and reckless experiment conducted by a lesser species on a primitive world they designated "Terra".  The Chronos-Weavers, those ancient beings of pure chronology, were dispatched under the watchful eye of Elder Lumina, their task immense – to mend the splintering realities before cascading paradoxes unraveled all.  From the ethereal Loom of Ages within Aethelburg’s core, the Weavers, led by the meticulous Hands of Clio and the intuitive Folds of Janus, extended their chronological threads, seeking the origin point of this catastrophe and the rogue energies loosed from the ill-conceived "Philadelphia Experiment," a term they gleaned from the fractured timelines. Their work was painstaking, a delicate dance across divergent histories, each thread a potential reality to be carefully re-woven back into the primary tapestries.
