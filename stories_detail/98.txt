The Annals of the Whispering Plains record the first documented encounter with the beings later known as the Hushed Choir around the year 783 AP (After the Founding).  Lord Aldric of Stonehaven, a seasoned explorer, ventured into the emerald expanse beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains, seeking rumored mineral wealth.  His journal, preserved in the archives of Oakhaven, speaks of an unsettling quiet that descended upon his party near the Crystaline Steppes.  He notes, with growing unease, a "melody not heard, but felt within the mind, a sweet sorrow that moved us to tears."  Initially, these telepathic harmonies were perceived as harmless, even beautiful.  However, the journal entries from Aldric's final days near the Forgotten Oasis become increasingly disjointed, describing a "cacophony of discordant whispers" that drove his men to "madness and despair."  The fate of Lord Aldric and his expedition remains unknown, a chilling testament to the unseen power of the Hushed Choir.

Centuries later, during the tumultuous reign of King Theron the Grim (1121-1150 AP), a scholar named Elara of the Silver Tower dedicated her life to understanding these enigmatic beings. Working from the hidden library of Blackwood Keep, she compiled ancient texts and oral histories, piecing together accounts from nomadic tribes of the Crimson Desert who spoke of "singing shadows" that could heal wounds or provoke violent frenzy. Her treatise, "The Resonant Minds," published in 1145 AP, proposed that the Hushed Choir's collective consciousness acted as a living, vibrating tapestry, capable of manipulating emotional states with the subtlety of a master artisan. She documented instances where isolated communities near the Silent Peaks, exposed to prolonged periods of their influence, descended into states of euphoric apathy or self-destructive rage, their societal structures crumbling under the weight of the psychic song.

It wasn't until the age of the Iron Guilds (circa 1400 AP) that concerted efforts were made to understand, or perhaps even control, the Hushed Choir. The Guildmaster Thorne, driven by tales of their ability to quell unrest, dispatched a contingent of his most disciplined soldiers to the Sunken Marshes, where a large concentration of these beings was believed to reside. The mission was a catastrophic failure. The soldiers, trained to resist conventional threats, were utterly defenseless against the onslaught of telepathic harmonies. Survivors returned with vacant eyes and fragmented minds, forever haunted by the "silent scream" of the Choir. The Guild's attempts to weaponize the Choir's power were abandoned, a stark reminder that some forces of nature are best left undisturbed in their ethereal chorus.
