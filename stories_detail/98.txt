The First Whisper came in the year 847 AE (After the Exodus), during the brutal siege of Aethelburg.  Lord Balthazar Thorne, a man hardened by countless campaigns, felt a sudden, overwhelming surge of despair wash over his weary troops.  It wasn't the enemy’s arrows or the crumbling walls that broke them, but a silent, invasive melancholy that sapped their will to fight.  Men wept openly, dropped their swords, and surrendered without resistance.  The enemy, the enigmatic Sarraceni, claimed no victory, but merely observed the dissolution of Balthazar’s army.  This was the first recorded instance of the Hushed Choir’s influence.

Centuries passed, and the legend of the "Silent Despair" grew. Scholars at the Grand Athenaeum of Veridian debated its nature, some attributing it to divine wrath, others to a rare atmospheric phenomenon. It was only in 1123 AE, during the reign of the sagacious King Alaric the Wise, that the true nature of the Hushed Choir began to be understood. A humble scribe, Sister Elara of the Order of the Veiled Quill, while transcribing ancient texts, stumbled upon fragmented accounts of beings who spoke without tongues, whose thoughts resonated like music in the minds of mortals.

The Hushed Choir, as Sister Elara pieced together, were not a single entity but a collective – a community of non-corporeal beings whose primary mode of communication was telepathic harmony. Their individual "voices" were not words but resonant emotional tones, and their collective "song" was a symphony of feeling that could be directed towards others. Initially, their influence was passive, a gentle ebb and flow of emotion in the ether.

However, it was during the tumultuous period known as the Sundering of the Free Cities (1305-1320 AE) that the Hushed Choir's darker potential became apparent. The city-state of Oakhaven, renowned for its vibrant artistic culture, was inexplicably plunged into a wave of collective euphoria. Citizens danced in the streets, neglected their duties, and engaged in increasingly erratic behavior. The city’s defenders, under the command of Captain Lyra Meadowlight, were incapacitated by an almost paralyzing joy, leaving Oakhaven vulnerable to attack. This wasn't mere happiness; it was a manic, uncontrollable delight that bordered on madness.

The sages of the time, particularly the reclusive philosopher Master Theron of the Whispering Peaks, hypothesized that the Hushed Choir, in their desire to experience emotions more intensely through the mortal form, were unintentionally, or perhaps intentionally, broadcasting their own internal states. When these states became imbalanced, the results on mortals were catastrophic. Oakhaven’s descent into ecstatic madness was a chilling testament to this theory.

Fear of the Hushed Choir spread throughout the known world. Treaties were signed, not against armies, but against the unseen influence. Cities enacted strict emotional regulations, attempting to build mental defenses against the invisible melodies. The city of Ironhold, known for its stoic inhabitants, implemented a daily regimen of repetitive tasks and emotion-suppressing rituals, hoping to create a mental landscape too barren for the Choir's harmonies to take root.

In 1458 AE, a breakthrough occurred in the hidden monastery of San’Doria. The monks, dedicated to years of mental discipline, discovered a way to not only resist the Choir's influence but to "hear" their individual harmonies. Abbot Gregor, a man of immense inner strength, described the experience as hearing "a thousand souls singing in unison, each with a different color and temperature." He noted that while the collective song could be overwhelming, the individual voices held unique emotional nuances.

It was through the patient work of Abbot Gregor and his disciples that the Hushed Choir’s motivations began to be understood. They were not inherently malevolent, but perhaps adrift, their existence a constant flow of emotion with little external connection. Their interactions with mortals were, in a twisted way, attempts at communication, albeit with devastating consequences.

The period that followed, from 1460 AE onwards, became known as the Age of Resonance. Efforts were made to establish a form of dialogue with the Hushed Choir. Scholars and mystics, trained in the techniques developed at San’Doria, attempted to send back controlled emotional responses, not as a weapon, but as a form of understanding. It was a slow and perilous process, fraught with moments of terrifying instability when the Choir's collective mood shifted.

While true communication remained elusive, the efforts of those who sought to understand the Hushed Choir brought a degree of predictability to their influence. The wild swings of madness and despair lessened, replaced by a more subtle, albeit still potent, ebb and flow of collective emotion. The Hushed Choir remained a mystery, a powerful and enigmatic force, but they were no longer solely the source of silent terror, but also a reminder of the hidden depths of emotion that resonated within the very fabric of existence.
