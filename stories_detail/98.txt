The Chronicles of Aethelgard, penned circa 847 CE, detail the first verified encounter with the creatures known only as the Hushed Choir, in the wildlands north of the settlement of Oakhaven during the brutal winter of 832 CE.  Led by the seasoned warrior, Sir Kaelen, and accompanied by the loremaster Elara of the Greyhold, the expedition sought refuge from a sudden blizzard when they were assailed not by blades, but by an insidious, silent melody that resonated within their very minds.  Sir Kaelen, initially unnerved by the discordant harmonies, ordered a hasty retreat, his men gripped by a growing, irrational dread.  Elara, however, a scholar of obscure lore, recognized the chilling signature of the Hushed Choir, beings whispered of in forgotten texts, whose collective 'song' could bend the will and shatter sanity, a truth tragically underscored by the unsettling madness that claimed the lives of several of the retreating soldiers before they reached the relative safety of the fortified manor of Lord Valerius by early 833 CE.
