In the autumn of 1648, in the hidden workshops of Krakow, after the passing of Master Alaric, the renowned Golem Carver, his daughter, Ilsa Alaricówna, reluctantly inherited his enigmatic tools and the whispers of his forbidden art. For years, she had witnessed her father painstakingly breathe life into unyielding clay and stone, a practice strictly forbidden by the Council of Elders, particularly the austere Rabbi Meir ben Moshe. Ilsa, a quiet woman in her early twenties, with hands more accustomed to mending tapestries than shaping granite, found herself faced with a collection of her father's unfinished creations – hulking figures of earth and rock, their eyes as yet unlit.  Driven by a desperate need for answers surrounding Alaric's sudden death, and perhaps a flicker of inherited curiosity, Ilsa dared to continue his work, igniting the arcane symbols etched into the golems' forms, unaware that within these silent sentinels lay not just animated stone, but the echoes of her father’s hidden failures and the seeds of a perilous uprising that threatened to engulf the city in the winter of 1649.
