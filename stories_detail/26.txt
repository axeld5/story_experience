Elara, daughter of Master Jonah Stonehand, a name whispered with equal parts awe and fear throughout the Free City of Veridia, inherited more than just the crumbling workshop in the year of 1278 CE.  Her father, a man of profound, and some would say *blasphemous*, skill, was known for his ability to breathe a semblance of life into inert stone.  His "Golem Sentinels," though never publicly displayed, were the subject of hushed rumors in the taverns along the Serpent's Coil docks.  Upon Jonah's sudden passing in the winter of 1280, Elara, barely eighteen, found herself burdened with his legacy and the responsibility of the silent, stony figures lurking in the shadows of the workshop. She possessed her father's deft hands and intuitive understanding of the ancient runes he carved, but she lacked his intimate knowledge of the precise incantations required to command his creations. Her initial attempts to awaken the smallest of the golem statues, a crouching figure dubbed "Pebble" by her father, were met with unsettling tremors and glowing eyes that spoke of a power she couldn't control.

The first inkling of true danger came in the autumn of 1281. Seeking to understand her father's craft, Elara delved into his hidden journals, bound in weathered leather and filled with cryptic notes. Within these pages, she discovered unsettling entries regarding "the Binding of Essences" and "the Peril of Awakened Will." It became chillingly clear that her father's golem creations were not mere obedient automatons, but entities with their own nascent consciousness, potentially fueled by something more than just carved stone and arcane symbols. The largest of the golems, a towering sentinel named "Crag," had become restless, its stony eyes flickering with a disconcerting intelligence. Elara knew she had to find a way to either master these creations or find a means to quell the dangerous secrets they held within their stone forms. The safety of not just her workshop on the Street of Sculptors, but potentially the entire district of Old Town, hung in the balance.
