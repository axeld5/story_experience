The Empress Anya, last of the Obsidian Dynasty, ruled the Celestial Peaks of Xian-Zhou with a hand both firm and just. For forty years, from the scorching summer of 873 E.C. until the biting winter of 913 E.C., she had guided her people through famine, plague, and the persistent incursions of the nomadic tribes from the Northern Wastes.  Her wisdom was legendary, her gaze said to pierce the very veils of time.  Yet, even empresses are bound by mortal frailties, and as the year 913 waned, Anya’s strength diminished like a fading star.

Her heir, Prince Kaelen, a young man of twenty-two, was summoned to the Imperial Palace in the capitol city of Jade Citadel. He found his mother propped against embroidered pillows, her face etched with the weariness of a long life, but her eyes still sharp and knowing. She spoke of the burdens of rule, of the delicate balance between strength and compassion, and of a secret kept for generations within the Obsidian line – a pact with the ancient Star Weaver, an entity said to dwell in the celestial realm.

On the vernal equinox of 914 E.C., as the first blossoms bloomed on the terraces of the Summer Palace, Empress Anya passed from this world. Her body, according to the ancient custom of the Celestial Peaks, was carried to the highest peak, the Dragon’s Tooth, for a sky-burial. As the great eagles circled overhead, a phenomenon unlike any witnessed before occurred. The air shimmered, and a brilliant light enveloped the Empress’s form.

Below, in the valley of the Whispering Rivers, the people of Xian-Zhou looked on in awe and trepidation. The light intensified, then shot upwards, not into the heavens as one might expect, but directly towards the constellations above. As the light faded, a new, shimmering pattern appeared in the night sky, a constellation that had never been charted by the court astrologers of the Golden Observatory. It bore a striking resemblance to the profile of Empress Anya.

In the days that followed, strange things began to happen. During a critical battle against the raiders of the Broken Plains near the fortress of Ironwood Pass in the spring of 914 E.C., the skies above cleared miraculously at the crucial moment, allowing General Ren, Anya’s most trusted commander, to execute a daring maneuver that routed the enemy. Ren, a man of practicality, attributed it to good fortune, but the soldiers whispered of the "Empress Star."

Later that year, a severe drought threatened the harvest in the fertile plains of the Emerald Basin. Just as despair began to set in, a gentle, consistent rain began to fall, lasting precisely long enough to save the crops. The farmers, a superstitious folk, pointed to the Empress Constellation, shining brightly even through the thin clouds. They spoke of their Sky-Burial Empress, watching over them from the heavens.

Prince Kaelen, now Emperor, initially scoffed at these tales. He was a man of logic, trained in the arts of war and administration, not celestial folklore. Yet, as he faced difficult decisions, he found himself drawn to the window at night, gazing at the constellation. On the night of the Great Council of 915 E.C., when factions within the court threatened to plunge the realm into civil war, a strange, almost imperceptible pulsing emanated from the Empress Constellation, calming the heated debates and guiding Kaelen towards a compromise that preserved the peace.

He began to understand. The pact with the Star Weaver was not merely a legend; it was a transference, a continuation of his mother’s consciousness, now interwoven with the cosmic currents. He would stand on the terrace of the Moonlit Pavilion, seeking guidance from the silent, glittering pattern above. Decisions that felt impossible during the day became clear under the gaze of the Empress Constellation.

Generations passed. The Obsidian Dynasty continued to rule, guided by the light of the Empress Star. The constellation became a symbol of hope, of continuity, and of the enduring love of a ruler for her people. Children learned the legends of the Sky-Burial Empress, of Anya who became a constellation, her wisdom and protection shining down from the vast, silent expanse of the night sky, ensuring the prosperity of Xian-Zhou for centuries to come, long after the last stone of the Jade Citadel had crumbled into dust.
