In the Year of the Crimson Comet, 732nd of the Celestial Calendar, Empress Ashara of the Verdant Dominion, known in hushed whispers as "The Weaver of Fate," lay upon her deathbed in the Grand Citadel of Aethel.  As her final breath escaped her lips, not a whisper of her spirit remained in the opulent chambers of the Sunstone Palace. Instead, the High Oracle Theon, keeper of the ancient texts of the Starlight Succession, witnessed a flicker of light ascend from the Empress's form, soaring beyond the obsidian spires of the capital towards the night sky.  Thus began the age of the Sky-Burial Empress, where the celestial patterns of the newly recognized Ashara's Crown constellation, appearing in the heavens over the Fields of Everlasting Plenty in the Spring of 733 CE, were interpreted by the Star Speakers of the Oracle's Tower, their pronouncements guiding the actions of her successor, Emperor Kaelen the Younger, through times of both famine in the desolate plains of the Barren Reaches (745 CE) and prosperity following the diplomatic accord with the Mountain Clans of the Spine of the World (758 CE), forever linking the destiny of the Verdant Dominion to the silent counsel of the stars.
