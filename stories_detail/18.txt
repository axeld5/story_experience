Empress Xifeng, daughter of the Jade Serpent and ruler of the Celestial Peaks since the Year of the Bronze Dragon (987th year of the Grand Cycle), was not a woman given to ordinary endings. Her reign, spanning three decades of peace and prosperity across the Three Valleys and the fertile plains of the Whispering River, was marked by a profound connection to the cosmos.  Upon her passing in the Year of the Obsidian Tiger (1017th year of the Grand Cycle) within the Grand Hall of Celestial Harmony in the capital city of Xingzhou, whispers arose not of her burial, but of a celestial ascent. High Priestess Lian Xiu of the Temple of the Azure Constellations recounted visions of the Empress’s spirit weaving through the night sky, her essence becoming one with the stars. The people, guided by centuries of tradition and faith in the celestial cycles, began to look to the heavens for guidance, interpreting the subtle shifts in the constellations as communications from their departed sovereign, now known as the Sky-Burial Empress.

Generations passed, and the Sky-Burial Empress remained a constant presence in the lives of the inhabitants of the Celestial Peaks. During the Great Famine of the Year of the Iron Boar (1052nd year of the Grand Cycle), when crops withered in the fields near the villages of the Verdant Foothills, the elder scholars of the Stellar College of Xingzhou interpreted a particular alignment of stars – now known as the Empress’s Tear – as a sign to seek new water sources high in the mountains. Their expedition, guided by this celestial omen, discovered hidden springs that saved the region from collapse. Later, during the Incursion of the Shadow Nomads from the Northern Wastes in the Year of the Stone Serpent (1087th year of the Grand Cycle), the positioning of the constellation of the Celestial Guard, traditionally linked to the Empress, was interpreted by General Rylan of the Iron Legion as a strategic directive, leading to a decisive victory at the Battle of the Crimson Pass.

The legend of the Sky-Burial Empress grew, woven into the tapestry of their history and culture. Festivals celebrating her celestial guidance, such as the Annual Star-Gazing Festival held in the ancient city of Lunar’s Embrace, became cornerstones of their society. The High Council of Xingzhou continued to consult the Stellar College for interpretations of the Empress’s will, believing her wisdom to be a timeless gift from the heavens, ensuring the continued prosperity and protection of their land, forever guided by the luminous presence of their ruler, who had transcended mortal existence to become a celestial guardian.
