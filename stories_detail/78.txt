The year is 987 AE, the Age of Embers, and Kaelen of the Scarred Hand, a moniker he earned over decades of agonizing inscription, knelt in the dimly lit chamber beneath the citadel of Eldoria.  Before him lay the latest addition to his living grimoire: a labyrinthine pattern of azure lines snaking across his chest, still raw and pulsing with nascent energy.  The Grand Inscribers of the Obsidian Order, elders steeped in the lore of the Somatic Arts, had deemed this new ward, the 'Shield of Aethelred', necessary after the recent skirmishes near the Whispering Peaks.  Each stroke of the enchanted needle by Master Elara the Unwavering, the current head of the Order, had sent waves of searing pain through Kaelenâ€™s flesh, a familiar agony he had endured since his apprenticeship began in the year 955 AE within the hallowed halls of the Somatic Sanctum.  His body was a testament to his power, each glowing line a word of the ancient Tongue, a verse in the visceral ballad of his magic.

Kaelen rose, his muscles trembling from the ordeal. The tattoos on his arms, remnants of earlier, less potent enchantments like the 'Fist of the Earth-Shaker' inscribed during his time guarding the mines of Veridian, pulsed with a dull crimson light. He touched the fresh inscription, feeling the power thrumming beneath his skin, a dangerous resonance that both protected and consumed him. The price of this power was not merely the searing agony of the needle, but a slow, insidious drain on his life force, a truth whispered among the Order's initiates but rarely acknowledged openly. Yet, the need for such power in these turbulent times, with the encroaching shadow of the Northern Clans, outweighed the cost. He was a living weapon, forged in pain and etched with power, ready to defend Eldoria against any who dared challenge its might.
