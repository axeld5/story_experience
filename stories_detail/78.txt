Before the Great Sundering of 1882, in the hidden City of Veridia, walked Kaelen, a sorcerer whose power was written upon his very skin, the first recorded Somatic Mage. His arcane energy, they say, wasn't conjured from ethereal planes or whispered incantations, but drawn from the intricate, glowing sigils that snaked across his flesh â€“ the Tattoos of Power, painstakingly inscribed by the Ascetic Crafters of the Whispering Peaks over decades of excruciating rituals, each line a burning brand against his being. Lord Valerius the Ruthless, Governor of the Northern Marches, witnessed Kaelen's terrifying display at the Battle of Aethelburg Field in 1879, where Kaelen's shimmering skin unleashed torrents of pure force, repelling Valerius's seasoned legions and solidifying the Somatic Mage's legend in the annals of the Age of Written Magic.
