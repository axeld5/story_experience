The annals of the Blackmire Fen, particularly the period following the Great Deluge of 1748, are rife with accounts of the Willowisp Pathfinders. Baron Silas D’Arcy, lost for three nights near the Whispering Weald in the spring of 1751, documented being led by flickering, ephemeral lights – the Pathfinders – their forms shifting and indistinct. He was brought not to civilization, but to a hidden grotto beneath the elder cypress known as "The Sentinel", a place not found on any maps of the Duchy of Arkenfell. Similarly, Captain Theron Vale, returning from a failed expedition to the Sunken Village in 1763, was guided through the treacherous Silt Channels by what his log described as "dancing sprites of pure light," only to be deposited at the foot of the desolate Grey Peaks, miles from his intended route to the garrison at Oakhaven. The motives for these diversions, and the true nature of these elusive entities, remained a persistent mystery throughout the era, a footnote in the history of the forgotten corners of the realm.
