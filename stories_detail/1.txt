Doctor Aris Thorne, Senior Archivist of the Chronology Institute, logged the 23rd Cycle of the Great Purification, dated 2147 A.D., in the sterile confines of the Chronoplast Chamber, located deep beneath the former city of London, now officially designated Sector 7.  His assignment, a routine temporal observation of post-Collapse societal restructuring in the North American territories, specifically the formation of the Concord of Appalachia around 2150 A.D., began like any other.  However, accessing the deeper, restricted temporal strata, a level usually locked to those of Thorne's clearance, inadvertently unveiled the *Project Chimera* files, a chilling prophecy detailing the architects of the Purification’s ultimate goal – a complete and permanent genetic rewrite of the surviving human population.  The realization, sharp and cold, spurred Thorne into a calculated defiance of the Chronoplast Protocol and Article VI of the Temporal Preservation Edicts, forcing him to initiate the unscheduled, unauthorized Temporal Leap to the precarious era of the Mid-22nd Century, risking temporal paradox and personal annihilation for the desperate hope of intervention.
