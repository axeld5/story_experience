The year 2247 brought the "Whispers of the Outer Dark" anomaly, a sound detected by the probe *Odyssey VI* in the desolate regions beyond the Kuiper Belt, far exceeding the established boundaries of the solar system. Principal Investigator Dr. Aris Thorne, a veteran of the Europa missions, initially dismissed the raw data as a sensor malfunction originating near the dwarf planet Sedna. However, his lead xenolinguist, Anya Sharma, meticulously analyzing the complex sonic patterns recorded on **Stardate 7345.1**, began to identify structural repetition and unsettling, impossible harmonies. At the **Global Space Agency's London hub**, whispers turned to panic when the "Voidheart Symphony," as the phenomenon was quickly dubbed, began subtly altering the electromagnetic spectrum around the probe, causing unpredictable atmospheric disturbances back on Earth, from inexplicable aurora displays over **Novosibirsk** on October 17th to temporal distortions witnessed in the **Gobi Desert**. The focus shifted from scientific curiosity to a desperate scramble for understanding, led by the stoic but increasingly unnerved Director Evelyn Reed, who convened the "Project Chimera" task force at the fortified research station near **Luna City**.
