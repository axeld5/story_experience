The Year of the Great Blight, 1347 of the Common Era, brought death on a swift wind to the lands of Eldoria.  From the bustling port of Aethelgard, it spread like wildfire, a crimson tide of fever and pustules.  Most died in agony, their breath rattling like dry leaves.  But for a scattered few, the Blight was not the end, but a brutal beginning.

Sir Kaelen of Blackwood, once a proud knight in the service of King Theron III, watched his family wither and die in their manor near Oakhaven. He himself succumbed to the sickness, his body wracked with chills and a fever that burned like molten lead. Yet, as the village priests prepared his shroud, Kaelenâ€™s eyes flickered open. The fever had broken, leaving him weak but alive, and marked. His skin was strangely mottled, his once-fair complexion a patchwork of pale and dark, and his eyes held a feverish intensity that unnerved those who saw it.

Lady Elara, daughter of the Baron of Silverwood, was attending court in the city of Veridia when the plague struck. She too fell ill, her delicate beauty ravaged by the disease. When she recovered, against all expectation, she found her senses amplified to a terrifying degree. The whisper of a mouse across a stone floor sounded like thunder, and the scent of decay clung to everything, a sickening reminder of the death she had skirted. Her family, repulsed by her altered appearance and unnerving sensitivity, cast her out.

These were not isolated cases. From the mining villages of the Ash Peaks came Garrok, a blacksmith whose hands, after surviving the Blight, could now withstand incredible heat. From the fertile plains of the Sunken Valley emerged Lyra, a healer whose touch, once gentle, could now accelerate or halt bodily processes with unsettling precision. They were the survivors, the marked, the ostracized.

Driven from their homes, shunned by the healthy, they gravitated towards the fringes. They found refuge in forgotten ruins and deep forests, their numbers slowly swelling. Their altered bodies, once a source of revulsion, were also a source of power. Kaelen's resilience was nigh unbreakable; Elara's heightened senses made her an unparalleled scout; Garrok's heat resistance allowed him to forge weapons of a quality unknown in the kingdoms; and Lyra's touch, though feared, could mend wounds that would kill lesser men.

They called themselves the Plague Rat Knights, a name born of the cruel taunts of those who had cast them out. It was a bitter irony, a reclaiming of a slur. Their armor was often makeshift, salvaged pieces, their banners plain. They had no liege, no fealty to any king or queen who had abandoned them in their hour of need.

Their first taste of organized action came in the summer of 1348, near the abandoned village of Blackwood (ironically, Kaelen's former home). A band of marauders, exploiting the chaos wrought by the plague, was terrorizing the few remaining inhabitants. The Plague Rat Knights, emerging from the shadows, struck with brutal efficiency. Kaelen's unwavering strength, Elara's uncanny ability to predict their movements, Garrok's heated blade, and Lyra's terrifying ability to induce incapacitating fever in their enemies proved a devastating combination.

News of their actions, distorted by fear and superstition, began to spread. Some whispered they were demons, others that they were vengeful spirits. But for the desperate and the oppressed, they became a source of faint hope. In the winter of 1350, they intervened in a brutal tax collection by the tyrannical Lord Borin near the town of Atheria, driving off his soldiers and distributing the seized grain to the starving populace.

Their existence remained a secret, whispered in hushed tones. They were the shadows that fought back, the forgotten who remembered. They were the Plague Rat Knights, born of death and ostracism, fighting for a world that had cast them aside, using the very diseases that had broken the kingdoms to forge their strength. Their fight was not for glory or gold, but for a semblance of justice in a land ravaged by sickness and the cruelty of men.
