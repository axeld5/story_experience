In the grim year of 1488, as the Black Breath raged through the Duchy of Valois, a curious and terrifying phenomenon emerged not from the gilded halls of power, but from the gutters of Nantes.  These were the Plague Rat Knights, once common foot soldiers and disgraced knights like Ser Kaelen "The Pox-Marked" and Lady Elara "The Fevered Hand," individuals ostracized for their proximity to the blight, yet inexplicably spared its final ravages.  Gathering in the forsaken villages of the Morbihan and the shadow of the Châteaugiron, these survivors, bearing the grotesque marks of their ordeal and exhibiting unsettling resilience, began to wield their newfound immunity and eerie abilities – a chilling resistance to disease, unnatural strength, and whispers of influencing the very pestilence they had overcome – against the bandits and mercenaries who preyed upon the weakened populace, forging a brutal and necessary order from the chaos left in the plague's wake.
