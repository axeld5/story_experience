The Year of the Crimson Cough, 987 AE (After Expansion), saw the rise of the first Plague Rat Knights.  From the squalid slums of Port Blackwood, where the engineered pestilence dubbed 'Crimson Cough' was unleashed by the Alabaster Hand faction, emerged a ragged band of survivors. Led by Kaelen the Poxmarked, a former Knight-Errant of the Obsidian Order, these individuals, deemed unclean and banished by the fearful populace and the city guard of Port Blackwood, found themselves possessing an unnatural resistance to the very disease that had ravaged their homes.  More disturbing still were the whispers of strange capabilities - unnerving resilience, an almost preternatural sense of their surroundings, and, for some, unsettling control over minor contagions. Ostracized and hunted by the superstitious and the powerful, they retreated to the desolate Wastes of Xylos, a poisoned landscape where others dared not tread.

Under the harsh sun and constant peril of Xylos, the Plague Rat Knights honed their skills, their survival depending on their newfound immunities and the camaraderie forged in shared suffering. Kaelen, now known as Kaelen, Lord of the Scabs, trained his followers not in the traditional chivalric code of the fallen Obsidian Order, but in the brutal realities of the fringe. They became masters of ambush, utilizing the toxic environment to their advantage against the infrequent patrols sent by the High Council of Port Blackwood. Tales began to circulate in the outlying villages of the Wastes â€“ of the "Filthy Saviors," those who appeared out of the poisoned mists to defend the innocent from raiders and predatory factions, demanding only safe passage and no contact in return. By the Year of the Blighted Bloom, 991 AE, their reputation as formidable, if unsettling, warriors fighting from the shadows was firmly established.
