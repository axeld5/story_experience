The 'Chimera Strain', or as it was initially and tragically mislabeled by the Ministry of Health, 'Seasonal Respiratory Anomaly 7', first surfaced in the remote fishing village of Oakhaven, British Columbia, in early April of 2042. Doctor Aris Thorne, a renowned geneticist from the University of Vancouver, was among the first to document the horrifying transformation, noting the unsettling avian features appearing on a fisherman named Thomas Croft, followed rapidly by the unsettlingly serpentine limbs of a young woman, Sarah Jennings. Thorne, a man of science and stark logic, initially struggled to reconcile the impossible, documenting the rapid spread across the North American continent by late May, christening it 'the Chimera Plague' in a desperate, ignored missive to the International Biosecurity Council on May 28th, 2042. His urgent warnings about "uncontrolled interspecies hybridization" and "impending ecological catastrophe" were unfortunately lost in the initial governmental inertia, allowing the strain to mutate with terrifying speed, leaving behind a trail of bewildered, terrifyingly altered creatures and a world teetering on the brink of an unprecedented ecological collapse.
