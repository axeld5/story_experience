In the autumn of 1488, within the shadowed scriptorium of the Monastery of Saint Augustine in Ghent, Brother Thomas, a copyist of some repute, found his quills stained not with ink, but with an otherworldly luminescence.  This coincided with the unnerving arrival of individuals claiming to be from the "Chronicle of the Weeping Baron," a notoriously macabre text completed by the reclusive scribe Master Anselm a decade prior. Lady Isolde, her face a canvas of perpetual sorrow, and Sir Kaelan, a knight of grim countenance, emerged from the parchment itself, their forms shimmering with the very ink that birthed them. They spoke not of salvation, but of seeking Master Anselm, their creator, believing only he could amend the tragic end he had penned for them within the cursed manuscript, a tale whispered to involve betrayal at the Battle of Oudenburg and a plague that swept through the lands near Bruges in 1479.
