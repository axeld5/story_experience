The year was 1783. In the dimly lit chambers beneath the Palais Garnier in Paris, the clandestine Order of the Penumbral Hand gathered.  Grand Shadow Master Elara, a figure as veiled as the secrets she held, orchestrated the dance of shadows projected onto a silken screen. Each grotesque caricature, a magically animated reflection of a European monarch or statesman, twitched and gesticulated under her silent command.  Across the Channel, King George III, a recipient of a particularly persistent spectral nudge, found his resolve to suppress the burgeoning American rebellion wavering, his advisors citing inexplicable shifts in his temperament since the spring of '82.

Meanwhile, in the opulent court of Catherine the Great in St. Petersburg, Advisor Grigori Petrovich, a man known for his sharp intellect, had begun to notice an unsettling pattern. Key policy decisions, seemingly arrived at through rigorous debate, bore a disturbing resemblance to fleeting thoughts that had crossed his mind hours earlier â€“ thoughts he couldn't quite trace to their origin. He began discreetly documenting these occurrences, noting peculiar instances, such as the sudden pivot in trade negotiations with the Ottoman Empire in the summer of 1785, a move that appeared to contradict established strategic objectives yet was inexplicably embraced by the Empress after a series of restless nights. The web of influence, woven by the Penumbral Hand and its ethereal puppets, was tightening its grip on the very fabric of global power.
