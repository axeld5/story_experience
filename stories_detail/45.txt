The whispers began subtly, then grew into a roar across the courts of Europe in the late 17th Century, a chilling undercurrent beneath the silks and powdered wigs. Lord Valerius, the Venetian Ambassador to France in 1698, penned a cryptic letter to the Doge, hinting at “phantom advisors” clouding the judgment of Louis XIV at Versailles.  Simultaneously, reports from Berlin mentioned the Elector Frederick William’s sudden abandonment of a crucial alliance, a decision seemingly influenced by unseen forces, while General Ivan Rostova in Moscow spoke of spectral figures swaying the Tsar's battle plans during the Great Northern War of 1700.  These were the early tremors of the Shadow Puppeteer Conspiracy, a clandestine order rumored to reside in the hidden catacombs beneath Prague, led by the enigmatic and ancient figure known only as "The Umbral Hand," their weapon not steel, but the subtly terrifying power of magically animated shadows, whispering insidious suggestions into the ears of kings and emperors, bending nations to their unseen will.
