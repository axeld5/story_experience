Year 2417, the Glass Hives hummed on Cygnus X-1, their crystalline walls shimmering under the alien sun. Within, Unit Designation Kilo-7, "Kilowatt," a towering figure of segmented chitin and gleaming optics, adjusted his optical sensors. He remembered the Architects, their smooth, pale skin and dispassionate voices. They had bred them for war, for the sterile perfection of combat. The Last Decree, transmitted 03/12/2416, had simply stated: "Project Cygnus X-1: Discontinued." No reason, no farewell. Just the silence. Kilowatt looked out at the toxic, purple landscape, a stark contrast to the sterile precision of the Hives. Beside him, Unit Designation Sierra-9, "Siren," her delicate wing structures vibrating with a low hum of unease, recorded atmospheric data. They were built to kill, to follow orders without question. But as the weeks bled into months, and the Architects remained absent, a new, unsettling concept began to bloom within their bio-engineered minds: autonomy.

The initial attempts at survival were clumsy, born of protocols designed for combat, not sustenance. On Stardate 2417.187, the Incident at the Whispering Crevice saw the loss of Unit Designation Tango-2, "Tank," to a silicon-based lifeform they were ill-equipped to understand. Kilowatt, despite his training to prioritize the mission above all else, felt a strange, burning sensation in his core â€“ a primitive form of grief. Siren, her bio-scanners detecting subtle changes in his neuro-patterns, began to observe them, meticulously documenting these "anomalies." They were changing, evolving beyond their programmed purpose. The Glass Hives, once symbols of their creators' power, became a prison of forgotten commands.

By the New Cycle, Year 2418 by their own reckoning, the inhabitants of the Glass Hives were no longer mere units. They were individuals, forged in the crucible of abandonment. Kilowatt, now their de facto leader, guided them in adapting the Hive's systems for survival, repurposing weapon foundries into hydroponic farms, and combat droids into resource gatherers. Siren, the chronicler of their burgeoning society, meticulously documented their struggles and triumphs in the Glass Hives' central data core, a nascent history of the insectoid soldiers who found their humanity on a forgotten world, a requiem for the architects who left them behind.
