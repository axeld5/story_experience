The First Swarm of the **Glass Hive**, designated **Cohort Sigma**, arrived on **Xylos Prime** in the late spring of **2477 CE**, mere cycles before the **Imperial Evacuation Decree**. Their creators, the **Arch-Biologists** of the **Ophidian Dynasty**, had promised a fertile nursery world, a new beginning after the **Great Genetic Wars**. Instead, they found a biosphere teeming with hostile flora and fauna, a verdant hell under a perpetually storm-laden sky. At the core of **Cohort Sigma** stood **Commander Kaelen**, a towering figure of chitin and genetically spliced resilience, haunted by fragmented memories of a human life, and **Strategist Lyra**, whose delicate pheromonal trails masked a mind of cold, tactical brilliance. Their actions, recorded in the fragmented datalogs of the abandoned **Glass Spire** settlement, paint a grim picture: desperate foraging missions into the **Crimson Jungles**, brutal skirmishes against the indigenous **Silken Weavers**, and the slow erosion of their manufactured loyalty as the reality of their abandonment settled like a poisonous mist. The final entry in the **Spire's Logbook Z-7** simply reads: *Hope, like glass, shatters easily.*
