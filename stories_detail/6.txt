The year is 2342 Standard Galactic Calendar. The place, a world designated simply as Xylos-7, a planet choked with venomous flora and predatory fauna. On this world, the remnants of the Glass Hive, Unit 734 "Mantid" of the Sol-Arboreal Alliance's Insectoid Infantry, faced a fate not of their design. They were, in the parlance of the time, "biological constructs," bred for war against the burgeoning K'tharr Hegemony. Created in the gleaming orbital laboratories of the Dyson Sphere known as ‘The Sunstone Eye’, their lineage was a carefully curated blend of Terran mantis, the resilient Xylosian sand-hopper, and undisclosed synthetic components.

Their creator, the celebrated yet reclusive bio-engineer Dr. Aris Thorne, envisioned an army that needed no complex machinery, one that could thrive in the harshest environments. Mantid, like his brethren, possessed chitinous armor, multifaceted eyes that saw beyond the visible spectrum, and powerful forelimbs ending in razor-sharp pincers. They were built for efficiency, for survival, for killing. And for a time, they performed their task admirably, pushing back K'tharr incursions on the brutal border worlds.

The shift came abruptly in 2348. News of the Sol-Arboreal Alliance's sudden, decisive peace treaty with the K'tharr reached Xylos-7 through a garbled subspace transmission from the retreating fleet. The Glass Hive, strategically positioned on a planet now deemed irrelevant, were simply... left behind. No resupply, no extraction orders, just silence. Mantid, their designated leader, felt a strange sensation – a hollowness where programmed purpose once resided.

Among the survivors were the stoic warrior, Unit 901 "Scaraba," whose strength was legendary, and the surprisingly inquisitive Unit 618 "Aphid," whose smaller size belied a keen intellect and a fascination with the organic world of Xylos-7. There was also the volatile Unit 887 "Wasp," whose aggression, once a valuable asset, now threatened to tear their dwindling unit apart.

The first few months were a brutal struggle for survival. The native fauna of Xylos-7, unhindered by the Alliance's presence, proved far more dangerous than the K'tharr in their own domain. They lost units to acid-spitting flora and pack predators with exoskeletons tougher than ceramite. The rigid military hierarchy began to fray as instinct and necessity superseded protocol. Scaraba learned to adapt their fighting style, recognizing the need for cooperation rather than pure force.

Aphid, meanwhile, became their reluctant botanist and zoologist. Their programmed understanding of Xylos-7's biology, meant for tactical exploitation, was now a vital resource for finding edible organisms and avoiding lethal ones. They cataloged strange, bioluminescent fungi and analyzed the venom of the ubiquitous "spine-vipers," their reports painstakingly etched onto discarded Alliance datapads.

Wasp's descent into uncontrolled fury was perhaps the most difficult challenge. Their inherent aggression, honed for the battlefield, now turned inwards and outwards, fueling paranoid rages and violent outbursts. Mantid, tasked with maintaining order, found themselves mediating conflicts that had no military objective, only the desperate struggle for survival.

It was during a particularly lean period, when their synthesized nutrient stores ran dangerously low, that Aphid made a remarkable discovery. Deep within a cavern system, they found a cluster of crystalline formations that resonated with their internal energy readings. Through trial and error, they discovered that these "lumina crystals," when exposed to certain electromagnetic frequencies, could generate a weak but sustainable energy source.

This discovery, however small, represented a turning point. It wasn't a tactical victory, but an act of adaptation and ingenuity that went beyond their programmed parameters. Mantid observed the growing cooperation between Aphid and Scaraba, the former's intellect guiding the latter's strength, and a nascent sense of something akin to community began to stir within the remnants of the Glass Hive.

As the years bled into one another, marked by the cyclical appearance of Xylos-7's twin moons, the Insectoid Infantry of Unit 734 began to change. They were no longer just soldiers, but survivors. They built rudimentary shelters from the tough hides of fallen beasts and learned to cultivate the few edible plants Aphid had identified. They even developed a form of non-verbal communication beyond their tactical chatter, a complex interplay of clicks, antenna movements, and subtle energy pulses. They were becoming something new, something forged in the crucible of abandonment. The Glass Hive, once a symbol of manufactured warfare, was slowly, painstakingly, becoming a home.
