The whispers of the Arcanotech Archives, nestled deep within the shimmering spires of Aethelgard, first reached the ears of Grand Artificer Kaelen of the Iron Cog Guild in the year 783 of the Age of Enlightenment.  Driven by a thirst for the forgotten blueprints, Kaelen, accompanied by the skilled spellblade Lyra and the grizzled veteran, Commander Jax, embarked on the perilous journey through the treacherous Whispering Peaks. Their quest was fraught with peril, for the Archives were fiercely guarded by the Techno-Mages of the Obsidian Hand, led by the enigmatic Arch-Mage Valerius, a master of both arcane power and clockwork contraptions, who saw the mingling of magic and technology as a sacred secret to be protected at all costs.
