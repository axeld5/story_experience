The Crimson Succession of 783 AE saw the death of King Valerius III, High Keeper of the Blood-Opal, at his summer palace of Veridia, leaving the kingdom of Aethelred poised on the precipice of chaos. His eldest son, Crown Prince Regulus, a skilled but arrogant blood-mage, immediately asserted his claim, facing opposition from his younger, more politically astute brother, Prince Corvin, who had cultivated support among the Guilds of Solara and the merchant houses of Port Ankar. Amidst the brewing civil war, the enigmatic High Priestess Seraphina of the Temple of the Veins in Oakhaven, guardian of the ancient rituals tied to the Blood-Opal's power, declared her neutrality, a move that hinted at a deeper game being played for control of the pulsating heart of Aethelred itself.
