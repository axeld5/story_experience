The history of Eldoria, penned by Arch-Chronicler Kaelen of the Azure Tower, is etched in the crimson glow of the Blood-Opal Throne.  The year 784 PE (Post-Exile), saw the reign of King Atheryn the Pious, a ruler whose grasp on the sacred gemstone, known as the Heart of Eldoria, was weak. His cousin, Lord Regent Valerius of the Blackwood Marches, a master of subtle blood-weaves, saw opportunity.  Whispers of Atheryn's fading vitality, his inability to replenish the gemstone's脉动 (pulse) with sufficient life force, spread from the High Council chambers to the farthest reaches of the realm, including the remote outpost of Cinderfall.

Valerius, a man of iron will and veins pulsing with controlled power, consolidated his support amongst the war-lords of the northern territories. Baron Theron of the Crimson Peaks, a brute who wielded blood magic with terrifying directness, pledged his legions in the spring of 785 PE. Meanwhile, Atheryn, guided by the cryptic pronouncements of the Sybil Elara at the Temple of the Veiled Goddess, attempted a desperate ritual to revitalize the Heart. The ritual, performed on the eve of the Summer Solstice in the Royal Sanctuary of Eldoria City, failed catastrophically, leaving the King weakened and the gemstone’s pulse faltering.

The Blood-Opal Throne, a seat of power forged in ages past, became the focal point of a swift and brutal struggle. On the morning of the Vernal Equinox, 786 PE, Lord Regent Valerius, his eyes burning with blood-infused power, marched upon the royal palace, his banners emblazoned with a crimson wave. The Loyalists, led by Captain-General Lyra of the King's Guard, fought fiercely but were ultimately overwhelmed. Valerius, standing before the still-glowing Blood-Opal, solidified his claim, his blood magic resonating with the ancient heart of the kingdom.
