The year is 2247 CY, and the mining operations deep within the Scars of Aethelgard, a land still bearing the wounds of the Silent War of 2210, were pushing deeper than ever before. Under the employ of the powerful Magnolarian Mining Conglomerate, a crew led by Foreman Kaelan "Iron-Hand" Jorvik were extracting the peculiar crystalline formations known colloquially as "Echo Shards." These solidified sound memories, remnants of the warâ€™s horrifying psychic weaponry, were prized for their unique properties in advanced sonic technology. On a particularly sweltering summer day, August 14th, 2247, as Kaelan and his crew, including the veteran miner Old Man Theron and the young, eager apprentice Anya Rostova, struck a vein of unusually vibrant shards in Sector Gamma-7, a low hum vibrated through the bedrock.

This was no ordinary geological tremor. The Echo Shards, saturated with the residual agony and terror of the fallen combatants, had, unknown to the Magnolarian geologists, acted as a prison for something far older and more terrible: dormant psychic entities, remnants of the pre-Magnolarian civilizations that had clashed on this very ground millennia ago. As the resonant frequency of the shards was disrupted by the extraction, these entities, long held in stasis, began to stir. Anya, the most psychically sensitive of the crew, was the first to feel their presence, a creeping dread and a cacophony of alien thoughts flooding her mind. Old Man Theron, recognizing the subtle signs of psychic disturbance from his own experiences in the war, tried to warn Kaelan, but his words were lost in the sudden, overwhelming psychic feedback that erupted from the shattered vein.

The consequences were immediate and catastrophic. The dormant entities, now fully awakened, lashed out. The Echo Shards in the mine vibrated violently, unleashing distorted echoes of battle cries and death throes that physically manifested as sonic blasts, tearing through the tunnels. Miners fell, their minds overwhelmed by the psychic onslaught. Foreman Kaelan, despite his renowned stoicism, found himself wrestling with visions of long-dead soldiers and forgotten horrors. This marked the beginning of the Echo Shard Rebellion, not of flesh and blood, but of ancient psychic forces, inadvertently unleashed by human greed and the reckless pursuit of technological advancement. The mines of Aethelgard, once a source of profit, became a battleground once more, against an enemy that could shatter minds as easily as rock.
