In the year 2447 of the Unified Calendar, deep within the Chrystalline Caverns of the planet Cygnus XI, a routine extraction by the Echo Shard Miners' Guild uncovered a horrifying truth. Foreman Theron "Stonehand" Gable, a veteran of the Cygnusian Wars of 2430, and his team, including the skilled psychic prospector, Elara "Resonance" Vance, were harvesting solidified sound memories – the precious Echo Shards – from the ancient battlefield known as the Whispering Flats. As Elara’s psionic probes breached a particularly dense formation near the ruins of the old Cygnusian Command Center, they inadvertently shattered the dormancy of the Syllable-Kin, ancient, formless entities whose consciousness was woven into the very fabric of the Echo Shards, their awakening marked by the chaotic psychic storm that tore through the minds of the miners and heralded the Echo Shard Rebellion.
