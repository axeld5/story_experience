Detective Inspector Alistair Finch, a man whose tweed suit seemed perpetually rumpled, stood in the sterile laboratory of the Neo-Paris Police Department's "Ecto-Tech" division on the brisk morning of March 17th, 2147. The room, usually humming with diagnostic equipment, felt unnervingly quiet.  Before him, projected onto a shimmering plinth, flickered a partial image: the iridescent, fragmented form of a young woman. This was Elara Vance, the celebrated quantum physicist, found lifeless in her Arc de Triomphe penthouse just two days prior.  Dr. Evelyn Reed, the lead Ecto-Tech specialist, a woman with a perpetually focused gaze and a cascade of grey hair escaping her bun, explained with a sigh, "We managed to capture a residual personality trace from her neural interface, Inspector. It's not a full recording, mind you, more like... an echo. A holographic ghost." Finch, a veteran of a hundred 'real' murders, felt a familiar unease coil in his gut. Interrogating a ghost, even a digital one, was a first for him.

Over the following week, within the confines of the precinct's soundproof interview room at the Rue de Rivoli annex, Finch meticulously pieced together Elara's fragmented memories. Each flicker of her holographic form, each garbled snippet of dialogue projected through the room's advanced sonic emitters, was a clue. There were glimpses of hushed conversations in the shadowy corners of the "Quantized Cafe" near the Sorbonne, fleeting images of a nervous man with a distinctive scar above his left eye, and the chilling echo of a metallic clang, sharp and final. Finch, armed with a notepad and a skepticism that bordered on the legendary, cross-referenced these spectral clues with physical evidence gathered at the scene â€“ a spilled cup of the popular "Neuro-Fuel" beverage, a single, distinctive cufflink discovered under a chaise lounge, and encrypted data fragments salvaged from Elara's personal chronometer.

The digital specter, though incomplete, provided a unique perspective, a look through the victim's own eyes, or rather, her digital imprint. It was a frustrating process, full of dead ends and maddeningly incomplete information. Yet, through perseverance and a touch of old-fashioned detective work, Finch began to construct a narrative from the ether. The fragmented "ghost" of Elara Vance, against all logic and the skepticism of his colleagues, was slowly but surely leading him towards a tangible, breathing killer, a shadowy figure operating within the complex and often dangerous world of cutting-edge Parisian technology. The holographic ghost was not just a witness; it was the key to unlocking the truth behind Elara Vance's untimely demise.
