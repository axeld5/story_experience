In the stifling summer of 2097, within the chrome-and-glass canyons of Neo-Tokyo, Detective Hiro Tanaka of the Cybercrimes Division found himself staring at the shimmering, ethereal form hovering above the late Ms. Anya Sharma’s bio-bed in her upscale Shinjuku apartment.  It was Tuesday, August 14th, a day that would be forever etched into the annals of the Neo-Tokyo Police Department, as Tanaka, a decorated officer known for his meticulous work on the ‘Ghost-in-the-Machine’ virus cases of ‘95, began the unprecedented interrogation of a Digital Remnant, the fragmented 'echo' of Ms. Sharma's final moments, hoping it held the key to the gruesome slaying that had occurred mere hours before dawn.
