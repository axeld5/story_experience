The year was 3417 CR (Crystal Reckoning), within the iridescent heart of Geodecity, a world sculpted from a colossal, hollowed-out crystal.  Life here was a stratified shimmer, dictated by one's distance from the radiant Core, the lifeblood of this subterranean metropolis. Lord Kaelen of the Inner Radiance, his chambers pulsed with the Core's raw energy, a privilege granted only to those born closest.  Meanwhile, down in the Outer Shards, amongst the echoing caverns and faint luminescence, lived Elara, a Shard Weaver. Her days were spent mending the fractured crystalline structures that held the city's outer layers together, a vital but thankless task.  News of the "Core Resonance," a strange fluctuation in the energy output, had begun to ripple outward from the central spire, sparking whispers of unease even in the deepest reaches of the Outer Shards, a tremor that reached even the dusty confines of Sector 7-Gamma on the eve of the Vernal Equinox, 3417 CR.

Elara's grandfather, the venerable Elder Jorn, had spoken of such disturbances in hushed tones, tales passed down through generations of Shard Weavers. He claimed they were harbingers of change, though whether for good or ill remained shrouded in the crystalline mists of history. One particularly unsettling report arrived on the 12th of the Second Cycle, detailing a localized power surge near the Grand Atrium, a place usually reserved for the privileged few. This incident spurred Elara to action. Driven by a potent mix of curiosity and a burgeoning sense of injustice, she began to secretly investigate the Core Resonance, her intricate knowledge of Geodecity's crystalline architecture proving an unexpected asset. Her clandestine inquiries led her to a hidden network of tunnels beneath the Atrium, a secret forgotten by all but a few, including, perhaps, those residing in the shielded laboratories of the Upper Strata.

Her path intersected with that of Jax, a Core Technician disillusioned with the strict hierarchy of his calling. Jax, born within sight of the Core's glow in District 3, had witnessed firsthand the inconsistencies and suppressed information surrounding the Core Resonance. Their shared concern over the increasingly erratic behavior of the city's energy source, coupled with a growing suspicion of the Inner Radiance's motives, forged an unlikely alliance. They met initially in the shadowy marketplaces of the Mid-Layers, a neutral zone between the opulent Inner Radiance and the struggling Outer Shards, their furtive conversations taking place under the watchful, yet often indifferent, eyes of the crystalline guards. This alliance, born of necessity and a shared desire for truth, would soon challenge the very foundations of Geodecity's stratified society, a challenge that began to gain traction in the mid-months of 3418 CR.
