In the 3rd Epoch of the Crystalline Age, within the colossal Geodecity, societal stratification was starkly defined by one's proximity to the Pulsing Heart, the energy core at the planet's center. Lord Kaelen, residing in the opulent Radiance Sector of 2407 CE, decreed stricter regulations for the lower tiers, particularly the Shardlands beyond the 9th Layer. It was there, in the dim, crystalline caves of the Deep Crystalline Caves, that Aella, a "Shard-Dweller" and descendant of the infamous revolutionary, Silas Thorne, plotted. On the 17th day of the Cycle of Lumina, fueled by whispers of ancient core-magic forbidden to the outer layers, Aella and a small band of dissidents, including the shrewd merchant Elara from the Echoing Caverns, initiated the "Coreward Push," a desperate gamble to reach the Radiance Sector and expose the inequalities that had plagued Geodecity for centuries.
