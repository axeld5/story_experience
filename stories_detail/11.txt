The year was 482 of the Crystal Age, and Geodecity hummed with a resonant, ever-present thrum. This colossal, hollowed-out crystal world, a cosmic anomaly discovered centuries prior, had become the unlikely cradle of a complex civilization. Its heart pulsed with a vibrant energy core, the source of light, power, and the very air the Geodeans breathed. Society, predictably, mirrored the planet's structure, stratified by proximity to this vital core.

At the center, in the incandescent glow of the Corelight District, resided the Luminaries. They lived lives of gilded privilege, their homes sculpted from the purest crystal, bathed in the core's effulgence. Among them was High Lumen Seraphina, her skin iridescent with absorbed energy, her pronouncements carrying the weight of prophecy. Her pronouncements, however, rarely reached the shadowed periphery.

Further out lay the Refraction Tier, where the Crystal Artisans toiled. Master Elara, her hands calloused but steady, spent her days shaping and channeling the energy, creating the conduits and filters that sustained the city. Life here was comfortable, a balance of labor and measured leisure, a world away from the opulence of the Corelight but still blessed by the core's warmth.

Beyond them, in the ever-deepening twilight, were the Shardlands. This was the realm of the Shard Miners, those who delved into the crystal crust, extracting the raw materials that built and sustained Geodecity. Life here was harsh, the air thin and cool, the luminescence a distant, mocking glow. Kaelen, a young miner with eyes that held the fatigue of generations, knew only the gritty reality of the deep.

The great social divide, etched in crystal and light, remained largely unchallenged for centuries. The Decree of Proximity, issued in 215 CA, codified this stratification, stating that "affinity to the Corelight shall determine one's station and fortune." This decree, inscribed on a towering crystalline monolith in the Grand Atrium, was a constant reminder of their place in the cosmic hierarchy.

Yet, simmering discontent began to stir in the lower tiers. Whispers of inequity, carried on the faint thermal currents from the Corelight, reached the Shardlands. The legendary "Dark Spark," a folk hero of uncertain origin, was said to be plotting a way to bypass the strict energy distribution, a notion dismissed as dangerous fantasy by the Luminaries.

The turning point came in 498 CA, a year etched in Geodean history as the "Shimmering Uprising." A sudden surge in core activity, an event later dubbed the "Great Pulsation," disrupted the carefully balanced energy flow. The Corelight District was momentarily overwhelmed, while the Shardlands plunged into an unprecedented, chilling darkness.

It was Kaelen, guided by an ancient, almost forgotten map etched on a shard of pre-Geodean crystal, who discovered a hidden network of subterranean veins. These veins, bypassing the main conduits controlled by the Luminaries, offered a direct, albeit unstable, connection to the core's energy.

Fueled by desperation and the whispers of the Dark Spark, the Shard Miners, led by Kaelen and a charismatic former artisan named Lyra who had fallen from the Refraction Tier, initiated their desperate gambit. They began tapping into the hidden veins, a perilous undertaking that risked catastrophic energy surges.

The resulting chaos, a dazzling and terrifying display of uncontrolled energy, forced High Lumen Seraphina to confront the reality of the lower tiers' desperation. Faced with the potential collapse of the entire city, she reluctantly agreed to negotiations, mediated by the wise and respected Master Elara from the Refraction Tier. The Geodecity Blues, the melancholic songs of the Shardlands, finally reached the core.
