The year was 2477, and the *Deep Core Drifters*, a tenacious crew led by Captain Eva Rostova aboard the deep-bore vessel *The Mantle's Reach*, punched through the planet Xylos's silicate crust on Cycle 38 of their mission.  Their target: rich therrilium veins within the turbulent lower mantle.  Beneath the scorching, crushing pressures of Site 7, beneath layers of solidified magma thought utterly devoid of life, Senior Geologist Dr. Jian Li's seismic readings registered anomalies far beyond expected mineral formations.  Through reinforced probes, they glimpsed shimmering, crystalline growths and structures unlike any known technology â€“ the remnants of an ancient, silicon-based civilization, the "Geodes," as they were later dubbed in official reports from the Mars Colony Archives.  Chief Engineer Davion Hayes, initially skeptical, quickly adapted their drilling schematics to accommodate delicate biological analysis, a move that, on Stardate 2477.103, forever altered humanity's understanding of life in the cosmos, ushering in the era of Xenopetrology and the "Xylos Protocol."
