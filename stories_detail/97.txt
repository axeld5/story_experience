The year is 2247. On the barren, copper-skied world of Xylos IV, beneath the scorched crust, the deep core drilling operation "Phoenix Down" was pushing into uncharted territory. Lead Geologist Dr. Aris Thorne, a man whose beard was as legendary as his stubbornness, oversaw the project from the subsurface station, Alpha-1. His team, a motley crew of seasoned miners and greenhorn geologists, were meticulously carving out new tunnels in the planet's fiery mantle. It was during the standard geological survey on Cycle 347, near the coordinates designated "Ignis Profundus," that something extraordinary occurred. Miner Jax "Dynamite" Riley, renowned for his uncanny ability to spot unusual formations, reported strange, crystalline growth unlike any known mineral. Initial analysis by Dr. Kaelan Vance, the team's xenobotanist (a field considered more theoretical than practical on Xylos IV), suggested an organic origin, a claim met with considerable skepticism from the mining guild.

Undeterred, Thorne ordered further exploration. What they found defied all understanding of life. In vast, echoing caverns, illuminated by the incandescent glow of the surrounding rock, pulsed a vibrant ecosystem of silicon-based creatures. Towering, geometric forms moved with an alien grace, their bodies shimmering with internal light. More astonishing still were the structures, colossal and intricate, carved from the very mantle itself. They resembled immense cathedrals of solidified lava and glowing crystals, bearing symbols that spoke of a forgotten civilization. Data logs from this period, particularly Thorne's personal journal entries dated June 18th, 2247, detail the team's awe and trepidation as they navigated this impossible world, a testament to the courage of those who dared to drift into the deep core.

The discovery at Ignis Profundus, initially kept secret by the United Mining Conglomerate out of fear of disruption, eventually leaked to the wider galactic community. The "Deep Core Drifters," as Thorne's team became known, had not only found life where none was thought possible, but also evidence of a history far older and stranger than galactic civilization had ever imagined. The subsequent rush to Xylos IV, the political maneuvering, and the scientific debates that followed are a story for another time, but the initial moments of wonder and terror experienced by Thorne, Riley, Vance, and the rest of the Phoenix Down crew in those glowing, silent caverns remain a pivotal chapter in the annals of exploration.
