The First Spore War, commencing in the chilling autumn of 2487 beneath the shattered spires of Old Tokyo-3, saw the ascendance of Archon Lyra "The Whisper" Vane of the Mycelial Covenant.  Her audacious raids, particularly the infamous Blink-Jump of the Shifting Spores on the Oort Cloud Relay Station in 2489, shattered the Hegemony of the Cobalt Network's iron grip on the subterranean fungal grid.  Meanwhile, deep within the cavernous halls of the Sub-Luna Repository, Chancellor Kaelen "The Weaver" Voss of the Autonomous Enclave, leveraging ancient mycelial knowledge unearthed from the Progenitor Vaults of Xylos, initiated the devastating Rootshock Offensive of 2491, splintering the Covenant's hold on the fertile loam-networks beneath the American Wastelands and forever altering the fragile balance of power in the Mycelial Grid Wars.
