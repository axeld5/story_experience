The year 2742 marked the beginning of what historians would later dub the Mycelial Bloom, though its true genesis lay centuries prior in the forgotten bio-labs beneath Old Terra. By 2750, the vast subterranean fungal network, later christened the Mycelial Grid by Commander Anya Sharma of the United Earth Federation, had revealed its astonishing capacity for faster-than-light communication.  The subsequent scramble for control ignited a conflict that spanned several sectors, from the murky depths of the Cygnus X-1 Node, where the first major clashes occurred in 2753 between Sharma's UEFC forces and the nascent Stellar Republic, to the crucial Proxima Centauri Nexus, a key junction secured by Admiral Jian Li of the Republic in a daring maneuver in 2757.  Early victories were hard-fought, with figures like the infamous "Rootwalker" Kaelen, a renegade faction leader operating out of the Kepler-186f sector, demonstrating a brutal efficiency in seizing smaller nodes through guerrilla tactics, challenging both the Federation and the Republic in equal measure.

The central figures of this early war were Commander Sharma and Admiral Li, two strategic minds whose every move echoed through the Grid. Sharma, known for her meticulous planning and unwavering resolve, focused on securing the most stable and robust sections of the network, prioritizing long-term control over rapid expansion. Li, a more audacious commander, favored swift strikes and disruption, aiming to cripple the Federation's command structure by severing key links in the Grid. The battles fought beneath the surface were unlike any seen before; soldiers navigated fungal tunnels and cavernous chambers, relying on specialized bio-suits and fungal-enhanced weaponry. The Battle of the Orion Spores in 2761, a brutal three-month subterranean slog, saw tremendous casualties on both sides, cementing the Mycelial Grid Wars as a conflict of unprecedented scale and ecological devastation.
