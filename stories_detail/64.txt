The **Chronicles of the Burning Peaks**, penned by the High Scribe Elara in the Year of the Obsidian Star (1234 AE - After the Exodus), detail the tireless vigil of the **Ashfeather Sentinels**. These colossal figures, born from the fiery heart of Mount Cinder and imbued with the ethereal essence of its perpetual smoke plumes, stood as silent guardians over the **Ruins of Eldoria**.  Chief amongst them was the **Winged Colossus, Ignis**, whose basalt wingspan cast a shadow over the crumbling archways, a formidable obstacle to the **Dune Raiders** who dared to trespass in 1237 AE, seeking forgotten **Eldorian artifacts** beneath the watchful, unblinking gaze of the **Stone Eagles** carved into the mountainside.
