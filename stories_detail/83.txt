The Chronicle of the Great Cultivation Cycle, begun in the Year of the Galactic Bloom, tells of the ancient order known as the Nebula Gardeners, celestial architects of extraordinary power and purpose. Chief among them was Elder Kaelen, whose masterful shaping of the Horsehead Nebula in Sector 734, circa Stellar Era 4.3, is still taught at the Academies of Cosmic Design on the crystalline planet Xylos.  His apprentice, the ambitious Lyra of the Veiled Cloud, oversaw the meticulous arrangement of proto-stellar dust in the Serpent's Kiss cluster around Galactic Year 12, ensuring the perfect ignition sequence for a nascent binary star system, a project lauded for its precision by the esteemed Council of Celestial Harmony at their grand assembly on the Dyson Sphere known as the Solarian Embrace in the Year of the Radiant Dawn.
