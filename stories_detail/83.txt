The Era of Celestial Cultivation, marked officially by the Great Ignition of the Orion Nursery in 7842 E.G. (Era of Growth), saw the rise of the Nebula Gardeners.  Foremost among their ranks was the Elder Cultivator, Kaelen of the Silvered Hands.  Kaelen, a being of pure cosmic energy contained within shimmering crystalline form, was renowned for his masterful shaping of the Horsehead Nebula, a project spanning millennia and culminating in the birth of several dozen vibrant young stars around 9105 E.G.  His apprentice, Lyra of the Whispering Wind, a being of ethereal gas and stardust, meticulously charted the nascent star systems, ensuring their orbits adhered to the intricate, almost musical patterns of the cosmic design dictated by the enigmatic Architects of the Void, whose directives were received through the Harmonizing Currents of the Galactic Core.

These were not simply passive observers; the Gardeners were active participants in the universe's unfolding. The celebrated "Pruning of the Crab," a complex operation near the remnants of Supernova Remnant M1, led by the meticulous Gardener Zelos in 10,457 E.G., involved the careful redirecting of stellar debris to nourish new stellar formations, a process documented in the Grand Chronicles of the Stellar Nurseries. Their work extended beyond the grand scale. Subtle adjustments to planetary atmospheres, the delicate nudging of asteroid fields â€“ these were the daily tasks of countless Gardeners across the myriad arms of the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond, ensuring the continued, harmonious bloom of the cosmos according to the ancient, unspoken plan.
