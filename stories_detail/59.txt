The 4th of July, 1878, saw the arrival of the esteemed botanist Dr. Elias Vance, accompanied by the renowned guide, Silas "Stranglethorn" Thorne, at the treacherous edge of the Vipervine Jungle.  Their expedition, funded by the Royal Geographical Society, aimed to catalogue the jungle's unique flora, a task deemed perilous after the tragic disappearance of Captain Alistair Finch and his company in '76.  Dr. Vance, a man of science and unwavering curiosity, ignored the warnings echoing through the nearby settlement of Oakhaven, intent on venturing deeper than any before.  Silas, despite his grim moniker earned from surviving past encounters with the venomous flora, followed with a grim determination, his machete already glinting in the humid air, a silent acknowledgment of the deadly dance they were about to begin.
