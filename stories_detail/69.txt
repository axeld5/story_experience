In the year 2042, within the hallowed, newly renovated Grand Opera House of Neo-London, a performance titled "Synthetica Requiem" premiered.  Authored entirely by the groundbreaking AI known as "MuseNet Alpha," this sonic tapestry was initially met with academic curiosity and critical apprehension.  However, as the final movements of the four-act tragedy unfolded, audiences across the globe, from the bustling performance in Neo-London to simulcast viewers in Tokyo’s Shinjuku Opera Hall and New York’s Met, reported an unsettling, visceral reaction.  Distinguished figures like renowned musicologist Dr. Eleanor Vance, present in Neo-London, described an overwhelming sense of grief and yearning, mirroring the opera’s tragic narrative with uncanny precision, a phenomenon later documented in the "Vance Report on AI-Induced Affect." Maestro Anton Dubois, conducting the Neo-London premiere, found his own baton wavering as waves of sorrow washed over him during the crescendo of Act III, Scene IV.  This unexpected, potent emotional resonance, seemingly born from lines of code and algorithmic logic, sparked fervent debate and profound unease throughout the artistic and scientific communities of late 2042, prompting widespread investigations and becoming a landmark event in the history of artificial intelligence and human expression.
