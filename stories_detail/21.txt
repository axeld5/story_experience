The nascent days of the Synaptic Drifters, around the year **2142**, were a time of desperate experimentation.  **Doctor Anya Sharma**, a visionary neuroscientist working out of the **Neo-Cambridge Institute**, had hypothesized the existence of the Collective Unconsciousness as a tangible realm, a vast psychic ocean where thoughts and memories ebbed and flowed. Her groundbreaking work, detailed in the now-classified "Unseen Seas" document, led to the development of the first Synaptic Drifter prototypes.  These weren't the sleek, integrated implants of later generations, but bulky cranial arrays and nerve bundles that allowed individuals like **Subject Alpha**, later known as **"The Navigator" Elara Vance**, to dip a toe into this uncharted territory. Their initial forays were terrifying; fragmented dreams and raw emotions bombarded their senses, and they quickly encountered the parasitic entities Sharma dubbed "Psychic Leeches," creatures that fed on mental energy and distorted the very fabric of thought.

The early battles were brutal and often resulted in psychological collapse. The Drifters, operating from secure facilities in **Neo-Tokyo Sector 7**, had to develop entirely new forms of combat â€“ not physical, but mental. **Captain Kaito Ishikawa**, a former cyber-commando, proved unexpectedly adept at psychic defense, his disciplined mind a fortress against the parasites' insidious influence. He trained the first cohorts of Drifters in techniques of mental shielding and energy manipulation, establishing the foundational principles of "Cognitive Warfare." The infamous "Whispering Plague" of **2150**, a widespread psychic outbreak caused by an unchecked swarm of Leeches in the **Berlin Megacity**, underscored the urgent need for these Drifters. It was during this crisis that **"The Architect" Soren Kjeldsen**, a former architect whose mind could perceive and manipulate the very structures of the Collective Unconsciousness, developed the first mental "fortifications," creating safe zones within the psychic realm. Their actions, though largely unknown to the general populace, saved countless minds from succumbing to the parasitic tide.
