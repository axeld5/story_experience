By the time the Jupiter Brain Conspiracy was officially revealed on December 3rd, 2342, by the historian Dr. Aris Thorne of the Lunar University, the subtle manipulations had been ongoing for centuries. Evidence unearthed from the archives of the Outer Planets Authority on Europa detailed the unusual behavior of the Ganymede Research Station crew during the “Great Solar Flare of 2187,” attributing their survival to inexplicable navigational corrections. Further back, cryptic entries in the logs of the "Jovian Dawn" expedition in 2099, penned by Captain Elara Vance just days before her disappearance in the Great Red Spot, hinted at a disembodied intelligence within the storm's swirling eye. It was Thorne’s meticulous cross-referencing of these disparate accounts with the anomalous energy readings from the probes launched into Jupiter's atmosphere during the early 2300s by the Io Observatory that solidified the chilling truth: a collective consciousness, a silent, powerful entity, had been guiding the trajectory of human expansion and development within the solar system all along.
