Elara of Lyra, born on the winter solstice of 1347 in the small, stone village of Oakhaven, was no ordinary child.  From her earliest years, her slumber was visited by visions not of fantasy or joy, but of earth’s violent upheaval.  Her mother, Maris, a pragmatic healer, initially dismissed them as nightmares brought on by the harsh winters and meager rations.  But when Elara, at the tender age of seven, woke screaming of a “mountain of water devouring the coast,” the subsequent tidal wave that struck the fishing town of Port Blossom a week later, on the third day of Spring, 1355, could not be ignored.

The burden of these prescient dreams settled upon Elara’s young shoulders with the weight of mountains. She saw the earth crack open near the copper mines of Veridia, felt the ground tremble beneath her in visions of the sprawling city of Eldoria collapsing, and choked on phantom dust from dust storms yet to sweep across the plains of Aerin. Each dawn brought not relief, but the crushing knowledge of impending doom, a doom she was powerless to avert.

Word of the “Dreamtide Oracle,” as the villagers began to whisper, spread beyond Oakhaven’s borders. Scholars from the Grand Library of Astria arrived in 1362, their eyes wide with a mixture of skepticism and awe. Master Lorien, a renowned cartographer and natural philosopher, spent weeks with Elara, documenting her visions, correlating them with known seismic activity and historical accounts. He, more than anyone, understood the profound implications of her ability.

Yet, understanding brought no solace. Elara would weep after a particularly vivid dream, describing the panicked faces of people she had never met, the roar of collapsing structures, the stench of sulfur and ash. She would plead with local officials, with travelers passing through Oakhaven, with anyone who would listen, to warn those in the path of her dreamt-of disasters. Her pleas, however, were often met with disbelief, ridicule, or a weary resignation.

In the summer of 1368, Elara dreamt of the Earth’s fiery breath erupting from Mount Cinder, a seemingly dormant volcano overlooking the fertile valleys of the Hearthlands. She spent days attempting to reach the villages nestled at its base, her voice hoarse from shouting warnings. Old Thomas, a grizzled farmer who had known Elara since she was a babe, finally listened. He evacuated his family and a handful of neighbors just days before the volcano unleashed its fury, on the twenty-first day of the seventh month. The destruction was absolute, but Old Thomas's family survived, a small, bittersweet victory for Elara.

The year 1375 brought Elara's most terrifying vision yet: a series of devastating earthquakes centered around the heavily populated capital city of Eldoria. She foresaw the iconic Ivory Tower crumbling, the bustling markets reduced to rubble, and the river flowing through the city overflowing its banks. Elara, now a young woman of twenty-eight, traveled to Eldoria herself, arriving in the early spring, desperate to convince the city's leadership of the impending catastrophe.

Archon Silas, the city's ruler, a man more concerned with political maneuvering than prophetic dreams, dismissed her as a deluded soothsayer. He pointed to the city's sturdy construction, its historical resilience to tremors, and the lack of any immediate geological signs. Elara’s urgent warnings fell on deaf ears, echoing in the grand halls of the Archon’s palace like the whispers of a forgotten wind.

On the fourth day of the sixth month of 1375, the first tremor struck Eldoria, followed by a series of violent quakes that lasted for days. Elara, trapped in the ruined city, witnessed the horrors she had dreamt unfold with agonizing accuracy. She helped tend to the injured, her heart aching with the knowledge that so much suffering could have been prevented.

The years that followed were a blur of sorrow and weary travel. Elara moved from place to place, her dreams continuing to forecast nature's wrath. She predicted the great flood of the River Serpent in 1382, the landslip that buried the mining town of Blackrock in 1389, and the prolonged drought that withered the crops in the Western Plains during the summer of 1395.

Though she saved but a fraction of those she saw perish in her dreams, Elara's legend grew. She became known as the "Dreamtide Oracle," a figure both revered and feared. Her story became a somber testament to the fragility of human life in the face of nature's power and the profound, often lonely, burden of foresight. She died in her sleep in 1401, in a small cottage overlooking the sea, her last dream unrecorded, leaving behind a legacy of accurate, yet ultimately unheeded, warnings.
