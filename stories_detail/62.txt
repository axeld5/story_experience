The child was born in the year of the Great Flood, 1184 AE (After the Empire), in the small fishing village of Oakhaven, nestled on the coast of the Whispering Sea. Named Elara, she was known from a young age for her unsettlingly vivid dreams. While other children dreamt of fantastical creatures and sun-drenched meadows, Elara’s slumber was a theatre of terrifying visions: mountains crumbling, oceans boiling, and the very ground beneath their feet splitting open. Her first documented prophecy came in the spring of 1190 AE, a detailed account of a landslide that buried half of Oakhaven, a disaster that occurred exactly as she described days later. The villagers, initially skeptical, quickly learned to heed her warnings, though their efforts to evacuate or reinforce were often futile against the sheer force of the coming destruction.

As she grew, Elara’s reputation as the "Dreamtide Oracle" spread across the region of Eldoria. From the bustling city of Silverfall to the remote settlements in the Dragon’s Tooth mountains, her name was synonymous with impending doom. Lord Kaelen of the Silverfall Council, a pragmatic man, initially dismissed her as a superstitious curio. However, after Elara predicted the devastating earthquake of 1205 AE that leveled the city's outer districts, a prophecy delivered with chilling accuracy down to the hour, Lord Kaelen became a staunch advocate, though even his resources were limited against the scale of the calamities. Elara herself remained a solitary figure, burdened by the knowledge she possessed and haunted by the faces of those she could not save. The weight of the predicted Tsunami of 1212 AE, a vision of waves taller than the tallest trees, left her bedridden for weeks, the sheer terror of it etched onto her pale face long after she woke.

Despite the fear and despair she often inspired, Elara was also a source of desperate hope. People would travel for weeks to reach her humble dwelling, begging for insight into their future, hoping to glean some small warning they could act upon. Yet, her power was a cruel one. She saw the inevitable, the unchangeable forces of nature, a truth too vast and powerful to be averted by mere human will. The "Fires of the Dread Peaks," predicted in 1218 AE, raged for months, transforming the landscape into a scorched wasteland despite all attempts to contain them. Elara, the Oracle of Dreamtides, lived a life defined by catastrophe, a living testament to the formidable power of the natural world and the heartbreaking limitations of foresight.
