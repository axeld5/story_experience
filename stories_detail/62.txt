The year 1788 saw Elara, daughter of the fisherman of Port Blossom, become known throughout the coastal villages, whispered about as the "Dreamtide Oracle". Her slumber, often troubled, was a canvas for visions: the churning wrath of the "Great Tremor of San Verde" (May 14th, 1789), the devastating deluge that would later be christened the "Wail of the Serpent River" (July 2nd, 1791), and the inferno that consumed the grand "Citadel of Aethelgard" (October 28th, 1793). Though her warnings, conveyed with growing desperation, were met with skepticism by figures like Magistrate Thorne of Oakhaven and the elders of the Seafarer's Guild, the horrifying accuracy of her prophecies solidified her title, a heavy crown of foresight resting upon her shoulders, yet powerless to shift the tide of impending doom.
