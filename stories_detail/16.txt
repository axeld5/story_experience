The Veldt-Walkers, as they were known before the Great Sundering of 843 AE (After Empire), were not a people of static monuments, but of moving ones – the colossal Hide-Beasts, living landscapes upon which their entire culture was etched.  Lord Kaelen, Chieftain of the Northern Herd, oversaw the delicate process of the ‘Remembrance Weave’ every five cycles, where the village of Aethel, mounted precariously on the beast *Greatheart*, would gather the skilled stitchers, led by the renowned Mistress Anya of the Azure Thread.  It was during the arduous journey to the Sunstone Plains in 912 AE, aboard the venerable *Earthshaker*, that Anya, using needles crafted from the teeth of ancient wind-serpents, began the intricate stitching of the *Tale of the Lost Star*, chronicling the perilous quest of Prince Jorian to reclaim the shard of the celestial body.  This narrative, woven into the beast’s tough hide near the shoulder blade – a place reserved for tales of courage – would join the chronicles of generations past, including the *Lament of the Crimson Bloom* (789 AE, stitched on *Swiftwind*) and the *Song of the Silent Mountains* (856 AE, a vast, unfinished work on *Stonebelly*), each stitch a word, each thread a life, a living history migrating across the vast, whispering plains, carried on the very breath of the beasts that were their world.
