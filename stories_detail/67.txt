The year 2742 B.C. (Before Cartel Dominance) on the Outer Rim world of Xylos VI saw the initial sparks of what would become known as the Stellar Cartel Wars.  Before the rise of figures like *The Crimson Duke* of the Ryloth Syndicate or *Lady Vesper* of the Obsidian Hand, a less ambitious, but equally ruthless operative, *Silas "The Serpent" Vane*, began consolidating power along the vital K'tharr Hyperspace Lane. His initial maneuvers, detailed in the now-lost Imperial Registry of Classified Conflicts, were small-scale raids on competing spice caravans originating from the Core World of Coruscant, laying the groundwork for the decades of violent struggle that would engulf star systems from the Cadian Sector to the distant nebulae of the Cygnus Arm, forever altering the flow of illicit goods across the burgeoning Galactic Empire.
