In the year 873 AE (After Empire), the whispers of the Lunar Tide Cult began to creep through the damp docks and shadowed alleys of Port Vesper. Led by the charismatic and unnervingly pale Eldrin the Seer, these worshippers believed the moon, specifically during the periods of high and low lunar tide, was a sentient being, influencing the very fabric of reality. Their rituals, held under the pale moonlight of the Saltmarsh Flats, were rumored to involve blood offerings and strange incantations whispered to the churning waters. Records from the Port Vesper Municipal Archive speak of unexplained disappearances during the spring tide of 874 AE, coinciding with Cult activity, though no direct link was ever definitively proven by the City Watch under Captain Borin Stonehand.

Eldrin's influence grew, attracting those disillusioned with the rigid tenets of the Sunstone faith and seeking a connection to a more primal power. Among his most devoted followers were the taciturn Fisher Davian and the enigmatic Alchemist Lyra. Davian, whose family had been lost at sea years prior during a particularly fierce storm during a king tide, saw solace in appeasing the "Great Orb," while Lyra, ever experimenting with alchemical reagents and celestial alignments, found a fascinating congruence between the moon's phases and the potency of certain concoctions. Their most audacious ritual, attempted on the vernal equinox of 875 AE at the desolate Mooncaller's Ridge overlooking the Azure Coast, aimed to harness the peak tidal energy for a purpose never fully understood, leaving behind only scorched earth and a pervasive, unsettling silence.
