The chronicles of the southern Isles, specifically those pertaining to the year of 1487 AE, detail the unsettling rise of the "Lunar Tide Cult." Led by the charismatic, albeit unsettling, figure of High Priestess Elara, whose pronouncements were often accompanied by strange, rhythmic chanting, this sect believed the moon to be a sentient deity, its moods mirrored by the ocean's ebb and flow. Their most notorious act, according to the logbooks of Captain Silas Thorne, occurred during the Great Equinoctial Tide of Spring, 1488 AE, near the rocky shores of Whisperwind Cove. There, under the watchful gaze of the full moon, Elder Morwenna and her disciples, including the young but fervent follower, Kaelen, were observed engaging in rituals deemed “profane” and “dangerously misguided” by the local authorities in the port town of Havenwatch.
