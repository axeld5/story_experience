The year is 1788, and the whisper of the Lunar Tide Cultists slithers through the humid air of Port Cinder, a bustling, if grimy, port town clinging to the southeastern coast of the Colonies.  They were not a visible menace at first, more a murmur among sailors and dockworkers, tales of strange lights on the water during the deepest nights, of figures chanting on the isolated Salt Flats during the new moon.  Their belief was a simple, terrifying one: the moon was a living entity, its gravitational pull not merely a physical force, but the ebb and flow of its conscious breath.  And they, the faithful, sought to harmonize with this celestial being through perilous, often bloody, rites.

The first documented instance of their public activity occurred on May 12th of that year, during the peak of a perigean spring tide. A small fishing skiff, captained by the weary but sensible Silas Croft, stumbled upon a gathering on the jagged rocks of Serpent’s Tooth Shoal. He reported seeing cloaked figures silhouetted against the moonlight, their bodies contorted in what he described as "unnatural movements," and the chilling sound of a rhythmic, guttural chant carried on the wind. Silas, a man of faith but not of superstition, was deeply unsettled and returned to Port Cinder with a story few were willing to fully believe, though a ripple of unease spread through the tavern "The Drowned Anchor."

The de facto leader of the Cult, so far as anyone could ascertain, was a man known only as "The Tide Weaver." His true name was never discovered, though speculation pointed to him being a former ship's navigator, his mind perhaps unhinged by years at sea under the watchful gaze of the moon. He was a gaunt figure, his eyes possessing an unnerving intensity that seemed to reflect the very lunar light they so revered. His followers were a disparate group – disgruntled fishermen, lonely widows seeking solace, and even a few educated, if eccentric, individuals who found mainstream religion wanting.

One such follower was Abigail Thorne, the daughter of a respectable merchant family in the nearby settlement of Oakhaven. Abigail, a woman of intellect and a fascination with the natural world, became increasingly disillusioned with the strictures of polite society. Drawn to the whispers of a deeper connection to the universe, she began attending clandestine meetings held in abandoned warehouses along the estuary of the Blackwater River. Her family, particularly her stern father, Bartholomew Thorne, was oblivious to her nocturnal activities, believing her frequent absences were due to visiting ailing relatives.

The danger escalated dramatically on the night of the full moon of August 3rd, 1788. The Cult, emboldened by a series of successful rituals that they believed had brought a particularly bountiful fishing season, attempted a more ambitious ceremony on the treacherous sandbars near Osprey Cay. Their aim was to "draw forth the moon's favor" by offering a sacrifice to the highest point the tide reached. What this sacrifice was, remains a dark mystery, but whispers of stolen livestock and even missing persons began to circulate through Port Cinder.

Reverend Elijah Stone, the steadfast minister of the First Chapel of Port Cinder, grew increasingly concerned. He preached against the "idolatry of the celestial orb" from his pulpit, urging his congregation to remain vigilant. He also made discreet inquiries, speaking with Silas Croft and others who had witnessed the Cult's strange activities. His efforts, however, were met with a mixture of fear and indifference. Many in Port Cinder had their own struggles and were hesitant to invite the wrath of a group rumored to dabble in dark arts.

The climax of the Cult's activities in 1788 came on the night of the king tide, the highest tide of the year, on September 18th. They converged on the remote shores of Gull's Point, a desolate stretch of coast known for its powerful currents. Their ritual that night involved attempting to harness the raw power of the surging water, believing it to be the most potent expression of the moon's will. Accounts of what transpired are fragmented and colored by fear, but it is believed the Tide Weaver attempted a dangerous act of communion, one that backfired horribly.

Whether it was a miscalculation of the tide's strength, a failure in their arcane rites, or simply the unforgiving nature of the sea, the ritual ended in tragedy. Eyewitnesses, brave or foolish enough to watch from a distance, spoke of a sudden, violent surge of water that swept several of the Cultists away. The Tide Weaver himself was reportedly consumed by the waves, his final, desperate cries lost to the roar of the ocean.

The aftermath was one of grim recovery and lingering fear. Bodies washed ashore in the following days, identified by the strange symbols carved into their skin or the lunar charms they wore. Abigail Thorne was among the missing, her family left heartbroken and bewildered. The events of September 18th dealt a significant blow to the Lunar Tide Cultists in Port Cinder. Their numbers were drastically reduced, their leader gone, and the chilling outcome of their ritual served as a stark warning.

While the organized threat of the Cult in Port Cinder largely dissipated after the events of 1788, the memory of their dangerous devotion to the moon persisted. Tales of the Tide Weaver and his followers became part of local folklore, a cautionary tale whispered to children on stormy nights. Though scattered remnants of the belief might have lingered, the dramatic and tragic end to their most ambitious undertaking on Gull's Point served as a chilling testament to the perilous nature of worshipping a celestial entity with the raw, untamed power of the tides.
