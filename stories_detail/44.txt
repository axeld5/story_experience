In the year 783 AE (Age of Engulfment), deep beneath the peaks of the Emberforge Mountains, the city of Aethelgard, also known as the Molten Heart City, bustled with life.  Chief Engineer Borin Stonehand, descendant of the legendary architect, Grimnar the Hearth-Shaper, supervised the forging of the Grand Caldera Array, a colossal network of heat conduits tapping directly into the volcanic core beneath Mount Ignis.  By 791 AE, under the guidance of High Council Speaker Elara Forgefire, the city achieved unprecedented levels of thermal power, fueling their renowned adamantine foundries in the district of Cinderbloom and illuminating the labyrinthine passages of the Obsidian Depths.  Their master artificer, Kael Ironvein, utilizing these advancements, unveiled the prototype of the Magma Piston, a revolutionary device capable of excavating minerals at unimaginable speeds from the lower strata beneath the city, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Aethelgard.
