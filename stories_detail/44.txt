In the annals of the Great Earthforge, chronicles penned by High Scribe Borin Stonehand in the year 873 of the Age of Molten Dawn, we find the first mention of the Molten Heart City, originally known as Khaz'goroth's Cradle.  Founded by the legendary Dwarf King Gorok Stonebeard in the pre-dawn of the Age of Obsidian (around 450 BD - Before the Dawn), this subterranean marvel was carved from the living rock surrounding the colossal Heart of Ignis, the volcano's molten core. It was here that Master Smith Thorgar Flameseer, in the year 512 BD, perfected the 'Ignis Conduit', a network of heat-resistant pipes that drew upon the core's immense energy, powering the city's forges and enabling unprecedented metallurgical achievements, including the creation of the legendary Flame-Forged Golems.

The early years of Khaz'goroth's Cradle were marked by remarkable progress under King Gorok's wise rule and the relentless innovation of engineers like the famed architect, Dwarf-Maiden Brunhilda Irongrip, whose designs for the sprawling subterranean districts of 'The Obsidian Halls' and 'The Crimson Foundries' remain breathtaking to this day, built around 580 BD. However, challenges arose. The constant proximity to intense heat demanded resilience and ingenuity. The story of the 'Great Cooling Crisis' of 721 BD, when a sudden drop in core temperature threatened the city's power grid, highlights the resourcefulness of Chief Engineer Balin Coalfist, who devised a temporary geothermal reservoir to sustain the energy flow until the core stabilized.

As the Age of Molten Dawn progressed, Khaz'goroth's Cradle became the undisputed center of dwarven craftsmanship, its skilled artisans revered throughout the Underrealm. The city's wealth grew through trade in fire-forged armaments and heat-resistant materials, shipped through the perilous 'Magma Current Tunnels' to distant settlements like the Ironpeak Holds. Under the reign of King Thorvin Stonehammer (987 MD - Molten Dawn), the city was formally renamed the Molten Heart City, a testament to its unique relationship with the fiery core, a relationship that would continue to define its history for centuries to come.
