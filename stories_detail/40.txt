The Annum of the Twin Suns, 3458 CE, saw the rise of the Nebula Knights, a clandestine order operating from the orbital platforms of Xylos Prime.  Under the leadership of Grand Master Theron and his sentient starship, *The Celestial Aegis*, these bonded pilots became the unwavering shield of the Coreward Conduits, vital trade routes plied by merchant guilds like the esteemed House of Volarus. Their primary adversaries were the Solar Raiders of the Kuiper Belt, led by the notorious 'Sunfang' and his dread pirate fleet, who used solar winds as their unforgiving highways.  It was the legendary 'Battle of the Shimmering Nebula' in 3461 CE, where Captain Elara and her bonded vessel, *The Void Whisper*, outmaneuvered Sunfang's flagship, *The Inferno's Kiss*, that truly solidified the Knights' reputation as the guardians of intergalactic commerce, a legacy etched in the astroid fields of the Cygnus Arm.
