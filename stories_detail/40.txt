The year 3147, Galactic Standard Time, marked a period of burgeoning commerce across the Orion Arm, particularly along the volatile Cygnus Trade Lane.  It was here that the Nebula Knights, an order as ancient as the first interstellar probes, proved their mettle.  Their inception, tracing back to the Oath of Xylos in 2890, bound human pilots to sentient starships known as 'Astral Sentinels'.  Among the most renowned was Captain Kaelen 'Stormbreaker' Voss, bonded with the **Vigilant**, an Astral Sentinel famed for its precognitive abilities.  Their primary foe were the 'Solar Raiders', rogue factions of former deep-space miners and smugglers who had mastered the treacherous art of riding the solar winds, utilizing modified sun-sail skiffs and plasma cutters.  These pirates, often led by figures like the infamous 'Sunfang' of the Scythe Syndicate, preyed on unprotected cargo convoys carrying vital resources like quantium crystals and terraforming agents, jeopardizing the fragile economies of nascent colonies like New Antioch.

The critical engagement that cemented the Nebula Knights' legend occurred during the Siege of the Serpent's Pass in 3149. A massive Raider fleet, intent on crippling trade to the K'tharr Belt, ambushed a convoy defended by only a handful of Knights. Captain Voss and the **Vigilant**, alongside Commander Lyra 'Shadow Weaver' Tavani aboard the stealth-optimized **Whisperwind**, initiated a daring counter-offensive. While the **Whisperwind** used its unique cloaking technology to sow confusion and pick off isolated Raider craft, the **Vigilant** engaged Sunfang's flagship, the dreadnought *Corona*. The battle raged for solar cycles, a ballet of plasma bolts and shimmering energy shields against the backdrop of nebulae and distant suns.

Through sheer tactical brilliance and the unwavering bond between pilot and ship, the Nebula Knights turned the tide. Captain Voss, guided by the **Vigilant's** warnings, outmaneuvered the *Corona*'s heavy fire, allowing Commander Tavani to deliver a crippling blow to its main engines. The rout of the Solar Raiders at Serpent's Pass did not end their threat entirely, but it severely curtailed their influence and solidified the Nebula Knights' reputation as the unwavering guardians of the void, ensuring the free flow of trade and the continued growth of the Orion Arm.
