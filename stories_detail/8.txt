In the clandestine corners beneath Saint Jude's Cathedral, circa 1878, where the cobwebs hung thick as funeral shrouds, thrived the Geist Market. Here, specters like the spectral Baron von Krelling, infamous for the "Night of the Crimson Ribbon" in Vienna of '42, bartered forgotten treaties and whispers of buried treasure. Across the mildewed stones, Elara Vance, a medium known only as "The Whisperer of Whitechapel," negotiated for the lost lullaby of her deceased child, offering in return a week's worth of her own vibrant memories. The air crackled with the static of residual energy as figures like Silas Blackwood, the phantom of the Blackwood Manor tragedy of 1866, traded the location of a hidden will for the promise of vengeance against his living descendants, a deal brokered by the ethereal Mrs. Gable, a long-vanished proprietor from the London Docks.
