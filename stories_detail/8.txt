The Year of Our Lord 1788 found London shrouded not only in its usual fog but in whispers of the Geist Market, a spectral exchange said to convene in the liminal spaces between midnight and dawn.  Mr. Elias Thorne, a man of dwindling fortune and desperate curiosity, first heard of it in the taverns of Whitechapel, from a dockworker named Silas “Silas the Scar” Croft who claimed to have traded a vivid memory of his drowned wife for a ghost's warning about a rigged game of cards at The Black Swan Inn on October 14th. Elias, a failed scholar of the occult, saw not mere superstition, but opportunity. He sought out Mrs. Evangeline Finch, a reclusive medium residing near Highgate Cemetery, whose reputation for communicating with the departed bordered on the infamous.

Mrs. Finch, a woman whose eyes held the weary knowledge of countless spectral encounters, initially dismissed Elias's inquiries as the ravings of a deluded man. Yet, Elias possessed a key detail Silas had shared – the Market's preferred currency: unfinished business. On the night of November 3rd, beneath a sliver of moon, Mrs. Finch led Elias through a series of disused alleyways behind St. Paul's Cathedral, the air growing colder and the city's clamor fading. They arrived at a derelict warehouse, its doors creaking open onto a scene both ethereal and unsettling. Phantoms flickered like faulty lanterns, their forms indistinct but their intentions clear. A spectral vendor, identified by Mrs. Finch as the long-dead thief, "One-Eyed" Jack O'Malley, haggeled with a living man over a crumpled piece of paper said to contain the location of a hidden treasure, a secret O'Malley had carried to his grave in 1685. Elias watched, his breath catching in his throat, as a ghost traded the spectral echo of a betrayal for a living woman's promise to deliver a letter of forgiveness to her estranged daughter. The Geist Market was real, and it trafficked in the deepest parts of both the living and the dead.
