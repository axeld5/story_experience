In the humid summer of 1798, within the dusty confines of the Royal Geographical Society of London, Master Alistair Finch, a man whose reputation preceded him from the bustling docks of Bristol to the scholarly halls of Edinburgh, stumbled upon a set of peculiar charts.  Unlike the meticulously drawn coastlines of the New World, the uncharted territories of the Pacific explored by Captain Cook in 1770, or the established trade routes to the Indies charted by the Dutch East India Company in 1602, these maps, bound in weathered vellum and titled "The Serpent's Atlas," bore no discernible geographical markers.  Instead, they depicted swirling patterns of color and cryptic symbols, charts not of terra firma but of something far more unsettling: the forgotten grief for his lost love, Elara, tragically drowned near the shores of Weymouth in 1795, and the dangerous, buried memories of his tumultuous youth spent among the cutthroats of the Whitechapel district in the 1780s, maps that Alistair found himself inexorably drawn to explore, despite the palpable sense of dread they evoked.
