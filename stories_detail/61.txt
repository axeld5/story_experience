The year is 2142. From the arid Gobi Desert, a figure emerged – Temujin, the Steel Khan, a leader of the newly formed Cyber-Khanate. His warriors, the Golden Horde 2.0, a fusion of nomadic horsemanship and advanced cybernetics, swept across the Eurasian Steppe like a digital storm. They bypassed the crumbling defenses of the Neo-Byzantine League at the Battle of the Black Sea in 2145, pressing onward towards the ruins of Samarkand, which fell in the summer of 2146 under the strategic genius of General Börte, the Iron Hand. By 2150, the Cyber-Khanate, under Temujin’s iron will and guided by the Oracle of Astana, a bio-digital network channeling ancient knowledge, had resurrected a dominion stretching from the River Danube to the Yellow Sea, a terrifying echo of empires past, forged in steel and silicon.
