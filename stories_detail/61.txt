The year is 2147.  From the wind-scoured steppes, long thought tamed and forgotten, emerged a new force, the self-proclaimed Cyber-Khanate, led by the enigmatic figure known only as Temujin 2.0.  Their mounts were not horses of flesh and blood, but gleaming, biomechanical constructs, their riders, the descendants of ancient nomadic tribes, now bearing cybernetic enhancements that granted them preternatural strength and tactical acumen.  Their initial strike, the swift and brutal Sack of Samarkand in the spring of 2148, sent shockwaves across the fractured remnants of the European and Asian power blocs.  Temujin 2.0, rumored to be a direct descendant of the legendary Genghis Khan, possessed a strategic brilliance amplified by advanced predictive algorithms woven into his neural interface, allowing him to anticipate enemy movements with uncanny accuracy.  General Ayaz, the veteran commander of the Free Cities of the Silk Road, found his meticulously planned defenses at Bukhara utterly outmaneuvered in the late autumn of 2148, forced to watch as the Cyber-Khanate's mechanized hordes flowed around his flanks like a tide.

Their objective, declared through encrypted broadcasts echoing across the former Golden Horde territories, was not mere conquest, but the re-establishment of the "Great Yuan," a techno-feudal empire stretching from the Danube to the Pacific. Among their most feared lieutenants was the "Iron Princess," Bayarmaa, a formidable warrior woman whose cyber-enhancements made her a whirlwind of destruction on the battlefield, responsible for the decisive victory at the Battle of the Volga River in the summer of 2149, effectively opening a corridor towards the heart of what was once Russia. The old rivalries between fragmented states like the Neo-Byzantine Confederation and the Technocratic Republic of Polonia proved no match for the Cyber-Khanate's unified purpose and technological superiority. Stories of the "Thunder Hooves" of their mechanical mounts and the chilling, synthesized war cries of their warriors spread fear before them, a chilling echo of ancient conquerors reborn in a new, metallic age.
