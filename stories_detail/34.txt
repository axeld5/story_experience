The year is 1473 Anno Domini, and the fragile peace of the Holy Roman Empire was shattered not by earthly armies, but by a cataclysm of the otherworldly.  Known in later historical accounts as the Sundering of the Veil, this event centered around the alchemical laboratories of the Grand Duchy of Austria, specifically within the hidden chambers beneath the Hofburg Palace in Vienna.  Archduke Frederick V, later Emperor Frederick III, had commissioned a series of ambitious experiments, guided by the enigmatic alchemist known only as 'Magister Solis'.  Their goal was not gold, but to harness the very essence of creation, a reckless ambition that ignited the fabric between our world and realms undreamed of.  Witnesses in the Leopoldstadt district reported seeing the sky tear like burning silk on the night of September 22nd, and from the rents poured forth energies that defied natural law.

The immediate aftermath was a chaotic symphony of the impossible. The cobblestone streets of Vienna shimmered with unnatural light, while strange flora, reminiscent of ancient Hyperborea according to fragmented texts, sprouted from the ground. Creatures of nightmare, previously confined to folklore and the darkest corners of the Black Forest, now stalked the outskirts of the city. Among the first responders was Captain Johann von Dietrich, a veteran of the Hussite Wars, whose company of Landsknechts found themselves battling not mere men, but beings of molten rock and crackling lightning near the Simmering Gate. Elsewhere, Sister Agnes of the Convent of St. Ursula documented the arrival of spectral entities, their forms phasing in and out of reality, whispering forgotten languages. The traditional defenses of the city proved utterly inadequate against these new threats.

Amidst the pandemonium, unlikely heroes and villains emerged. Baroness Elara von Hohenlohe, a noblewoman with a keen interest in arcane knowledge, began to organize resistance forces, utilizing ancient family grimoires that detailed defenses against extra-dimensional incursions. Meanwhile, within the chaos, a shadowy figure known as 'The Weaver', a merchant from the Venetian Republic who had dealings in forbidden artifacts, was observed acquiring strange new materials and technologies that appeared to have been pulled from the Sundered Veil itself. The fate of Vienna, and indeed, the Holy Roman Empire, now hung precariously in the balance, its future irrevocably altered by the reckless pursuit of forbidden knowledge beneath the Hofburg.
