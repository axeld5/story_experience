The Anomaly of 1472, later termed the Sundered Veil by Arch-Scholar Kaelen of Aethelgard, struck without warning on the Vernal Equinox, ripping the ethereal tapestry that separated the realms of existence. This cataclysmic event, centered near the ancient city of Oakhaven in the Free Marches, didn't merely tear; it bled, spilling raw, chaotic energies that warped the very foundations of reality and stitched together disparate worlds. Lord Commander Valerius, renowned for his stoic defense of the Northern Watch, found his fortified border facing not only the usual goblin raids but also shimmering forests teeming with creatures unknown, and plains where the air hummed with the scent of alien suns. Meanwhile, High Priestess Lyra of the Sunstone Convent, deep within her sacred sanctuary near the Whisperwind Peaks, documented the unsettling appearance of spectral cities in the skies and the sudden, unnerving silence of the usually boisterous Wind Spirits, signs that even the spiritual realms were in turmoil, forcing her to dispatch emissaries to the fractured courts and frightened peoples, seeking answers in a world irrevocably changed.
