The year 2147 on Asteroid Colony Pallas-V saw the dawn of the Great Divide project, a colossal undertaking to split the celestial body with a zero-gravity corridor for trade and passage, a project championed by Governor Silas Thorne and his pro-expansionist faction. On one side toiled the Uppers, led by Foreman Eva Rostova of the Rostova Dynamics crew, her focus unwavering on the northern wall's meticulous construction using advanced graviton compressors. Across the ever-widening chasm, on the southern face, labored the Lowers, a more improvisational crew under the gruff but capable direction of Captain Finnian "Finn" O'Malley, their reliance on older magnetic anchors a testament to their resourcefulness. It was in the void between their work zones, during the mandated 14:00 standard time zero-G transfers of supplies, that Eva, with her precise, almost dance-like movements in the vacuum, and Finn, his powerful pushes sending crates hurtling across the darkness, first exchanged glances â€“ a silent acknowledgment across the chasm that would soon bridge more than just an asteroid.
