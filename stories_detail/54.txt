The Annals of the Stonefoot Tribe, dated to the late 9th Sun Cycle, meticulously record the rise of Elara, daughter of Chief Kaelen, to the revered, yet feared, title of Grief Eater. The practice was ancient, whispered about in hushed tones around the winter fires in the village of Oakhaven. When the great blight swept through the harvest fields in the Summer of the Lean Bellies, a collective despair settled over the tribe, heavier than any physical burden. The Elders, led by the wise Shamaness Mara, consulted the Ancestor Stones, and the call for a Grief Eater was heard. Young Elara, barely seventeen name-days passed, possessed a quiet strength, a stillness that marked her as a potential vessel.

The ritual took place under the Blood Moon of the Autumn Equinox, a night imbued with potent energy. Elara, adorned in simple deerskin and painted with white clay symbols of purification, stood before the community assembled in the sacred grove at the Whispering Falls. One by one, the villagers approached, placing a hand on her shoulder and silently releasing their accumulated sorrow â€“ the loss of children, the fear of starvation, the gnawing ache of uncertainty. Elara absorbed it, the weight visibly pressing down on her slender form, her eyes taking on a depth beyond her years. The chronicles of the following months speak of a palpable shift within Oakhaven; a return of hesitant smiles, a renewed vigour in the hunts, while Elara, the designated Grief Eater, bore the brunt of their collective pain, retreating to the quiet solitude of the High Peaks.

Master Scribe Theron, in his later entries from the Spring of the Returning Songbirds, describes the toll the practice took on Elara. Her laughter became rare, her dreams reportedly haunted by the echoes of a hundred sorrows. Yet, her sacrifice was undeniable. The tribe thrived, the blight receded, and the crops grew strong again. Elara, though forever marked by the weight she carried, was revered as a living sacrifice, a testament to the enduring strength and interconnectedness of the Stonefoot people in the harsh lands surrounding the Serpent River. The role of the Grief Eater, though a burden of immense magnitude, ensured the emotional health and survival of the community, a vital, albeit sorrowful, thread in the tapestry of their history.
