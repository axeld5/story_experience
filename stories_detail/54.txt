The village of Oakhaven nestled in the Shadowed Peaks had known sorrow in abundance.  For generations, since the Great Frost of 1488 that claimed half their children, they practiced the Grief Eater Ritual. It was not a joyous occasion, nor a voluntary one for those chosen. The burden was immense, a psychic weight that could crush a lesser spirit.

Elara was the current Grief Eater, a woman barely past her thirtieth winter, her face already etched with lines that spoke of a thousand mournings. Her predecessor, Old Man Theron, had finally succumbed to the weight two summers prior, his mind fractured and his body withered. Elara had been a reluctant successor, her youth still clinging to the edges of her spirit, but the elders had seen the quiet fortitude in her eyes.

The ritual took place during the waning moon, in the ancient clearing known as the Whispering Stones, a place said to be imbued with the very essence of the earth. The villagers, their faces solemn, would gather, bringing with them their sorrows, their regrets, their losses. Young Bran, whose father had been taken by the river just last spring, clutched a small, carved wooden bird, its wings broken. Widow Maeve, her husband lost to a fever five years ago, held a faded linen scarf to her lips.

Chief Kaelen, his voice raspy with age, would begin the incantations, calling upon the spirits of the ancestors to guide Elara. Elara, dressed in plain, dark cloth, would sit before the Stones, her eyes closed, her breathing slow and steady. The air would grow heavy, thick with unspoken pain.

Then, one by one, the villagers would approach Elara. They would kneel before her, their heads bowed, and speak, not of their sorrow, but of the *feeling* of it. The tightness in the chest, the hollowness in the gut, the burning behind the eyes. Elara would listen, her face impassive, and the psychic energy, the raw, unshaped grief, would flow into her.

The first few times, the influx of sorrow had been almost unbearable. Elara had felt the crushing weight of a hundred losses, the sharp sting of betrayal, the suffocating despair of hopelessness. She had screamed silently, her muscles tensing, her spirit recoiling. But she had endured.

Over time, a strange detachment had begun to settle over her. It was as if the grief, once inside her, became a separate entity, a dark cloud that she carried within her soul, but which did not consume her entirely. She learned to compartmentalize, to push the raw edges of the sorrow into a corner of her mind, leaving a small space for her own thoughts and feelings.

Yet, the toll was undeniable. Elara rarely laughed. Her movements were slow, deliberate. Her eyes held a deep, ancient weariness. The children of Oakhaven instinctively shied away from her, sensing the heavy burden she carried. They knew her as the Grief Eater, the one who bore their collective pain, but they did not understand the sacrifice.

One particularly harsh winter in 1512, the sorrows seemed to multiply. A brutal plague swept through the village, claiming many lives, including several elders. The grief was overwhelming, a tidal wave that threatened to drown even Elara. For days after the ritual, she was almost catatonic, lost in the depths of shared mourning.

But slowly, painstakingly, she would emerge. Weakened, yes, but not broken. She would walk among the villagers, her presence a quiet testament to their resilience. She had absorbed their sorrow, allowing them to continue, to find a flicker of hope in the aftermath. The Grief Eater was not a healer in the traditional sense, but a vessel, a crucial part of the delicate balance of Oakhaven. Elara knew her time would come, as it had for Theron, but until then, she would bear the weight, for her people, for the village nestled in the embrace of the Shadowed Peaks.
