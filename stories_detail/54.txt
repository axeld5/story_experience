In the year of the Green Moon, 783 PC (Pre-Conquest), nestled within the whispering valleys of the Serpent Spine Mountains, the village of Oakhaven prepared for the annual Grief Eater Ritual. Old Man Hemlock, the current *Shepherd of Sorrows*, a title bestowed upon those chosen for this sacred task, felt the weight of the coming days settle heavy on his aging shoulders.  Across the village square, young Elara, her hands stained with berries from the harvest, watched him with a mixture of awe and apprehension, for her own name, *The Seed of Suffering*, had been whispered by the elders for the next cycle. The ritual, conducted at the ancient Stone Circle of Aethelred near the Whispering Falls, was a stark and necessary one, where the communal sorrow – the losses of the harsh winter, the sickness that had claimed several children in the Spring of the Dying Flowers – would be drawn forth and consumed, a psychic burden borne by the *Bearer of Burdens* for the health of the whole.
