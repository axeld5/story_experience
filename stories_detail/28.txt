The year was 1938, in the city of Veridia, a place perpetually choked by the "Great Muckslides," a geological anomaly that had transformed its lower districts into a labyrinth of silt and shadow.  Detective Miles Corbin, a man as weary as the city itself, sat in his office on the slightly-less-submerged Cedar Street, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and stale cigarette smoke.  He was staring at the case file of one Isabella "Bella" Rossi, a singer from the notorious Mudpit Lounge in the sunken district of the Dregs, who had vanished without a trace two weeks prior, on the 4th of November.  Bella was known for her sultry voice and her rumored connections to the city's underbelly, a world Miles knew intimately, a world where secrets were buried as deep as the mud itself.

Miles had been working the case tirelessly, following leads through the treacherous, half-submerged alleyways of the Dregs, dodging mudskippers and the watchful eyes of those who preferred their business to remain hidden. He'd questioned Alphonse "Alfie" Dubois, the shifty owner of the Mudpit Lounge, a man with hands as grimy as the floor of his establishment. Alfie claimed Bella had simply walked out, but his eyes held a flicker of something more, a fear that went beyond a missing employee. Miles also spoke with Salvatore "Sal" Moretti, a dockworker from the perpetually damp docks of Pier 7, a man known for his quiet demeanor and surprisingly sharp observations. Sal had mentioned seeing a black sedan, unusual for the Dregs, near the Mudpit the night Bella disappeared. The vehicle, he noted, had a distinctive dent on the driver's side fender.

The scent of a lead, faint but persistent, guided Miles to the abandoned cannery on the edge of the Veridian River, a place where the mudslides had reached particularly high, swallowing entire floors. It was here, amidst the rusting machinery and the oppressive silence, that Miles found what he was looking for â€“ a discarded silk scarf, the same shade of crimson Bella had been wearing in the photograph on his desk, and beside it, a single muddy footprint, larger than a woman's. The secrets of Veridia were indeed buried deep, and Miles Corbin was about to unearth them, one layer of silt at a time.
