The year is 1927. New Haven, or what’s left of it, lay choked and gasping under a perpetual shroud of silt. The great flood of ’23 had never truly receded, leaving the lower districts, the ‘Gut’, a Venice of mud and misery. Detective Miles Corbin, a man whose fedora seemed permanently fused to his head and whose eyes held the weary wisdom of the submerged city, surveyed the scene. A body, half-buried in the viscous muck near the old docks of Oakhaven, a district known more for its whispers than its commerce.

The victim, identified as Arthur ‘Artie’ Croft, a small-time purveyor of dubious goods from the drier uplands of Elmwood, was a familiar face in the Gut’s seedy underbelly. His throat had been cut, a ragged line in the grey flesh, but it was the meticulous removal of his fingers that spoke of something beyond mere robbery. This was personal, a message etched in blood and mud.

Miles’s partner, the younger, more idealistic Detective Lena Petrova, knelt beside the body, her face grim. "No signs of a struggle, Miles. Almost like he… expected it." Her family had lost their home in the flood, living now in the crowded, precarious shacks built on stilts in the higher ground of Northwood. The flood had not only buried the city, but also the hope in many hearts.

The initial leads were thin as the air above the silt. Artie had been seen the night before at the ‘Drowned Pearl’, a gin joint built on a repurposed barge in the heart of the Gut. The Pearl’s proprietor, a woman known only as ‘Madam Eve’, was a master of the unspoken, her eyes holding the secrets of the city’s desperate souls. Miles knew she wouldn't offer anything freely.

He questioned Madam Eve in the smoky haze of the Drowned Pearl. She sat behind her counter, a spider in her web of illicit transactions. Her answers were evasive, laced with the familiar cynicism of those who had seen too much. She mentioned Artie had been acting nervous, asking about passage out of New Haven, something about a "package" he needed to move quickly.

Lena, meanwhile, pursued a lead regarding Artie’s known associates. She spoke with Silas Blackwood, a grizzled, one-legged former stevedore who operated a small, rickety skiff service in the Gut. Silas, reluctant at first, mentioned Artie had been arguing with a man he described only as "the Collector", someone who dealt in salvaged goods, the darker sort, from the submerged buildings.

The pieces began to align. The cutthroat methodology, the missing fingers (perhaps linked to a code or a warning), the need for quick escape, and the ominous figure of the Collector. The Gut was a graveyard of lost belongings, but also of lost pasts, and the Collector preyed on both.

Their investigation led them to the submerged library in the old university district of College Hill. Legends spoke of a hidden vault within, untouched by the flood, containing artifacts and knowledge long thought lost. Could Artie’s "package" be something from this vault? Something the Collector desperately wanted?

They found the Collector’s makeshift hideout in the upper floors of a partially submerged bank building in the financial district. The air inside was thick with the smell of damp paper and something metallic. The Collector was a gaunt, intense man named Elias Vance, surrounded by his morbid collection of salvaged items. Among them were a set of severed fingers, chillingly preserved.

Confronted, Vance confessed. Artie had indeed salvaged something from the library vault, an ancient, jeweled locket that held secrets more valuable than gold. Vance, who believed the locket was rightfully his, had tracked Artie down. The missing fingers were not a message, but a means of retrieving something Artie had hidden within them. The locket was now gone. The silt, it seemed, was still yielding its grim harvests.
