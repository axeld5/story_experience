The year was 1947, and the city of Port Cinder, a perpetually half-submerged monument to poor urban planning nestled by the Sludge River, was drowning in more than just mud.  Private Investigator Jack "Shadow" Doyle, a man whose trench coat smelled permanently of damp earth and despair, was hired on the 15th of October by Mrs. Eleanor Vanderbilt, a widow of considerable fortune and even greater fear, residing in the less-submerged Upper Estates district. Her husband, the influential Thomas Vanderbilt, had vanished a week prior, his disappearance coinciding suspiciously with a particularly violent mudslide that had swallowed the Lower Wharf district on the 8th. Doyle's investigation led him through the stinking alleys of the Lower Wharf, past the notorious "Silt & Shadow" speakeasy run by the enigmatic Miss Seraphina "Silken" Stone, and into the murky depths of Port Cinder's buried secrets, secrets whispered about by longshoremen and unearthed from the very mud that held the city captive.
